<h1 id="equation-of-line-from-known-slope-and-point">Equation of Line from Known Slope and Point<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-of-line-from-known-slope-and-point" title="Link to this title">Â¶</a></h1><p>Let's find the equation of a line with slope $2$ going through the point $(3,5)$.
The equation is $y = 2x+h$, where $h$ is an unknown number.
The point $(3,4)$ must be on the line, so it must satisfy the equation of the line:
$$
5 = 2 \cdot 3 + h
$$
From here we can solve $h = -1$, so the equation is $y = 2x-1$.</p>

<p>While this method works, it involves solving an equation, although the equation is very simple.
We can improve on this a little bit by doing the above work more generally,
and then just using the results later.</p>

<p>Let's find the equation of a line with slope $s$ going through the point $P=(P_x,P_y)$.
The equation is $y = sx+h$, where $h$ is an unknown number
The point $P$ must be on the line, so it must satisfy the equation of the line:
$$
\begin{align}
P_y &= sP_x + h \\
P_y - sP_x &= h
\end{align}
$$
We can plug this into the line equation:
$$
\begin{align}
y &= sx+h \\
y &= sx+P_y-sP_x \\
y-P_y &= sx-sP_x \\
y-P_y &= s(x-P_x)
\end{align}
$$</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>The equation of a line with slope $s$ going through point $P$ is
$$
y-P_y = s(x-P_x).
$$
</p>

</div><p>Let me show a different way to think about this formula.
From <a href="line-eq-slope.html">the slope line equation derivation</a>,
we know that a nonzero vector $\vec d$ goes in the direction of the line
if and only if $\frac{d_y}{d_x} = s$.
We also see that a point $(x,y)$ is on the line
if and only if the vector from $P$ to $(x,y)$ is in the direction of the line.</p>

By combining these results, we see that $(x,y)$ is on the line if and only if
$$
\frac{y-P_y}{x-P_x} = s,
$$
which can be rewritten as
$$
y - P_y = s(x - P_x).
$$
The above derivation doesn't work for $x = P_x$, because then it divides by zero.
In that case, the right side of the resulting equation is zero, and so the equation becomes just $y = P_y$,
which is indeed true if and only if $P$ is a point on the line
(the line isn't vertical, because it has a slope).</p>
