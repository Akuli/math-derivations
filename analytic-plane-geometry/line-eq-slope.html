<h1 id="equation-of-line-with-slope">Equation of Line with Slope<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-of-line-with-slope" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h1><p>Here's what we know about <a href="line-eq-normal.html">line equation in normal form</a>:
<ul><li>
The equation of any line can be written as $ax+by+c=0$, where at least one of $a$ and $b$ is nonzero.
</li><li>
Any equation $ax+by+c=0$, where at least one of $a$ and $b$ is nonzero, is the equation of a line.
</li><li>
$ax+by+c=0$ is called the normal form of the line equation,
because $a\I+b\J$ is the normal vector of the line, and it appears in the equation.
</li></ul></p>

<p>Let's solve the normal form line equation $ax+by+c=0$ for $y$:
$$
\begin{align}
ax+by+c &= 0 \\
by &= -ax-c \\
y &= -\frac{a}{b}x - \frac{c}{b}
\end{align}
$$
By letting $s=-\frac{a}{b}$ and $h=-\frac{c}{b}$, we get
$$
y = sx + h.
$$</p>

<p>Not all lines have an equation like this.
In the above derivation, we needed to divide by $b$, so it must be nonzero.
Now consider any line equation for which the above doesn't work; that is,
any line equation $ax+by+c=0$ with $b=0$.
Because at least one of $a$ and $b$ is nonzero, $a$ must be nonzero, so we can divide by it:
$$
\begin{align}
ax+0y+c &= 0 \\
ax &= -c \\
x &= -\frac{c}{a}
\end{align}
$$
This is the equation of a vertical line, so all lines lacking an equation like $y=sx+h$ are vertical.
This means that any non-vertical line has an equation like $y=sx+h$.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>The equation of a non-vertical line can be written as $y=sx+h$.
</p>

</div><p>This also goes the other way:
any equation like $y=sx+h$ is the equation of a non-vertical line, because we can rewrite it like this:
$$
\begin{align}
y &= sx+h \\
y-sx-h &= 0 \\
(-s)x + 1y + (-h) &= 0
\end{align}
$$
This is the equation of a line with normal vector $(-s)\I+1\J$.
This can't be a vertical line, because
any normal vector of a vertical line is horizontal and hence has no $\J$ component.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>Any $y=sx+h$ equation is the equation of some non-vertical line.
</p>

</div><h2 id="meaning-of-s-and-h">Meaning of $s$ and $h$<a class="headerlink" href="#meaning-of-s-and-h" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>Next we figure out what properties the numbers $s$ and $h$ have in $y=sx+h$.
By plugging in $x=0$, we get $y=s \cdot 0 + h=h$, so $(0,h)$ is a point on the line.
This gives an easy way to understand what the $+h$ part of the line equation does:
it sets the height at which the line intersects the $y$ axis.</p>

<p>Next we'll figure out the meaning of $s$, which is called the <b>slope</b> of the line.
By plugging in $x=1$, we get $y=s1+h=s+h$, so $(1,s+h)$ is also a point on the line.
Let $A=(0,h)$ and $B=(1,s+h)$ be the points we got so far.
Because they are points on the line, a vector between them is a vector that goes along the line:
$$
\Vec{AB}=(1-0)\I + ((s+h)-h)\J = \I+s\J
$$</p>

<p><img width="281" height="348" class="asymptote" src="../asymptote/cde2a692dc432de6bb740d5c8ac5f3e7.svg" /></p><p>If $\vec d$ is any nonzero vector in the direction of the line, then it's "$\Vec{AB}$ but stretched",
so there is some nonzero number $a$ for which
$$
\vec d = a \cdot \Vec{AB} = a\I+as\J.
$$
This leads to
$$
\frac{d_y}{d_x} = \frac{as}{a} = s,
$$
where $d_y$ and $d_x$ denote the components of $\vec d = d_x\I + d_y\J$.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>If $\vec d$ is a nonzero vector in direction of a non-vertical line $y=sx+h$,
then the slope of the line is $s=\frac{d_y}{d_x}$.
</p>

</div><p>Does this result also work the other way?
That is, if some vector $\vec d$ satisfies $s=\frac{d_y}{d_x}$, where $s$ is the slope of a line,
then does the vector go in the direction of the line?
The vector $\I+s\J$ goes in the direction of the line, as we saw above, and
$$
d_x(\I+s\J) = d_x\I + sd_x\J = d_x\I + \frac{d_y}{d_x}d_x\I = d_x\I+d_y\J = \vec d.
$$
This means that $\vec d$ and $\I+s\J$ go in the same direction,
so $\vec d$ must also go in the direction of the line.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>If $\vec d$ is a nonzero vector satisfying $s=\frac{d_y}{d_x}$,
where $s$ is the slope of some non-vertical line,
then $\vec d$ goes in the direction of the line.
