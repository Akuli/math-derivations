<h1 id="definition-of-derivative">Definition of Derivative<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-derivative" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h1><p>To motivate the definition of derivative, we show several different examples.
</p>

<h2 id="walking-speed">Walking Speed<a class="headerlink" href="#walking-speed" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>Let's say that you're walking along a line.
You might know that
$$
\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}.
$$
For example, if we move $3$ metres during $2$ seconds,
then the speed would be $\frac 3 2 = 1.5$ metres per second.
This is actually not quite right; the <b>average</b> speed is distance divided by time, $1.5$ metres per second,
but your actual speed might vary during those 2 seconds.</p>

<p>To approximate the actual speed, we can do the same thing with a small time interval.
For example, if we move $0.2$ metres during $0.1$ seconds,
then the average speed during the $0.1$ seconds is
$$
\frac{0.2\text{ metres}}{0.1\text{ seconds}} = 2\text{ metres per second},
$$
which measures your speed quite accurately.
To get the exact speed, we can do
$$
\text{speed} = \lim_{\text{time} \to 0} \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}.
$$
By definition of limit,
we can approximate the limit to any precision we want by measuring with a small enough time interval,
so it must be your speed.</p>

<p>Let $t$ denote time as seconds, and let $w(t)$ denote the distance that you have walked at time $t$.
Let $h$ be the length of the time interval (above we had examples with $h=2$ and $h=0.1$).
Consider the two moments at time $t$, and a little bit after it, at time $t+h$.
The corresponding walked distances are $w(t)$ and $w(t+h)$, so
the distance walked during the time interval is
$$
\text{distance} = w(t+h) - w(t).
$$
Plugging everything in, we get
$$
\text{speed}
= \lim_{\text{time} \to 0} \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}
= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{w(t+h)-w(t)}{h}.
$$
Here $h \to 0$ means that $h$ can be negative;
that means measuring the distance between a moment just a little bit before $t$ and the moment $t$.
</p>

<h2 id="download-speed">Download Speed<a class="headerlink" href="#download-speed" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>Let's say that we are downloading a big file.
You might know that
$$
\text{downloading speed} = \frac{\text{amount of downloaded data}}{\text{time spent downloading}}.
$$
For example, if $3\text{MB}$ gets downloaded in $2$ seconds,
then the download speed would be $\frac 3 2 = 1.5$ megabytes per second.
This is not quite right; the <b>average</b> speed is amount of data divided by time, $1.5$ megabytes per second,
but the actual downloading speed might vary during those 2 seconds.</p>

<p>To approximate the actual downloading speed, we can do the same thing with a small time interval.
For example, if we download $0.2\text{MB}$ during $0.1$ seconds,
then the average downloading speed during the $0.1$ seconds is
$$
\frac{0.2\text{MB}}{0.1\text{ seconds}} = 2\text{MB per second},
$$
which measures the downloading speed quite accurately.
To get the exact speed, we can do
$$
\text{downloading speed} = \lim_{\text{time} \to 0} \frac{\text{amount of downloaded data}}{\text{time}}.
$$
By definition of limit,
we can approximate the limit to any precision we want by measuring with a small enough time interval,
so it must be the downloading speed.</p>

<p>Let $t$ denote time as seconds, and let $D(t)$ denote the amount of data downloaded at time $t$.
Let $h$ be the length of the time interval (above we had examples with $h=2$ and $h=0.1$).
Consider the two moments at time $t$, and a little bit after it, at time $t+h$.
The corresponding amounts of downloaded data are $D(t)$ and $D(t+h)$, so
the data downloaded during the time interval is
$$
\text{amount of downloaded data} = D(t+h) - D(t).
$$
Plugging everything in, we get
$$
\begin{align}
\text{downloading speed}
&= \lim_{\text{time} \to 0} \frac{\text{amount of downloaded data}}{\text{time}} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{D(t+h) - D(t)}{h}.
\end{align}
$$
Here $h \to 0$ means that $h$ can be negative;
that means calculating the amount of data downloaded
between a moment just a little bit before $t$ and the moment $t$.
</p>

<h2 id="slope-of-tangent-line">Slope of Tangent Line<a class="headerlink" href="#slope-of-tangent-line" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>Let's say that we want to find the tangent line of the parabola $y = x^2$ at the point $(1,1)$.</p>

<p><img width="306" height="452" class="asymptote" src="../asymptote/5cadfd7848e3f6928157747ee2bcc303.svg" /></p><p>To find the equation of a tangent line,
we only need to find its slope;
once we have the slope, we can plug that and the point $(1,1)$ into
<a href="../analytic-plane-geometry/line-eq-slope-and-point.html">this result</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../analytic-plane-geometry/line-eq-slope.html#meaning-of-s-and-h">We know</a> that
if we have a tangent line, then any nonzero vector $\vec d$ along the tangent line
gives the slope as $\frac{d_y}{d_x}$.
We can't find a vector like that easily,
but we can instead consider a vector between $(1,1)$ and some other point $P$ on the graph.</p>

<p><img width="282" height="452" class="asymptote" src="../asymptote/abf90a1e889f3866002b8dbdfb8d346e.svg" /></p><p>If we do $\frac{v_y}{v_x}$, we don't quite get the slope of the tangent line
because $\vec v$ doesn't go in the direction of the tangent line.
However, if the point $P$ is near $(1,1)$,
then $\vec v$ goes almost in the direction of the graph and $\frac{v_y}{v_x}$ is almost equal to the slope:</p>

<p><img width="281" height="452" class="asymptote" src="../asymptote/7eb199358b2d6661bb6ade16bf21f128.svg" /></p><p>To get the exact speed, we can take a limit of $\frac{v_y}{v_x}$
with the point $P$ approaching the point $(1,1)$.
We can approximate the slope of the tangent line to any precision we want
by bringing $P$ close enough to $(1,1)$,
so by definition of limit, the slope of the tangent line is the limit.</p>

<p>Let $h = v_x$.
Then the $x$ coordinate of $P$ is $1+h$, and because $P$ is a point on the graph $y=x^2$,
the $y$ coordinate is $(1+h)^2$.
This means that
$$
v_y = (1+h)^2 - 1,
$$
so
$$
\frac{v_y}{v_x} = \frac{(1+h)^2 - 1}{h}.
$$
To bring the points closer to each other, we can take a limit with $h \to 0$,
because $h$ is the difference of the $x$ coordinates of the points:
$$
\text{slope of tangent line} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(1+h)^2 - 1^2}{h}
$$
Calculating this limit is straight-forward
(expand the top, cancel a lot of things and then use <a href="limit-props.html">limit properties</a>).
</p>

<h2 id="the-definition">The Definition<a class="headerlink" href="#the-definition" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>All of the above examples resulted in a limit of the form
$$
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h},
$$
where $a$ was some number and $f$ was some function.
Now we give a name for limits like this; this is the <b>derivative</b> of $f$ at $a$.
So, when you are learning to calculate derivatives,
you simultaneously learn to calculate
speeds of moving objects, downloading speeds, tangent line slopes and
many other things that can be described with a derivative.
