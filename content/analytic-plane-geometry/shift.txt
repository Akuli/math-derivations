# Shifting

When I say that a curve has been shifted right by some positive number $a$,
I mean that the shifted curve consists of the points of the original curve,
with $a$ added to the $x$ component of each point.
For example, shifting the below blue parabola right by $5$ gives the red parabola:

asymptote:
    unitsize(1.5cm);

    real f(real x) { return x**2 - 6*x + 10; }
    axises(-0.5, 10, -0.5, f(5));
    path G = graph(f, 1, 5);
    transform T = shift(5, 0);

    draw(G, p=blue);
    draw(T*G, p=deepred);

    pair P = (4,2);
    dot(P, L="$(" + string(P.x) + "," + string(P.y) + ")$", p=dotpen);
    dot(T*P, L="$(" + string((T*P).x) + "," + string((T*P).y) + ")$", p=dotpen);

Let's shift any curve right by some positive number $a$.
How to figure out whether a point $P=(P_x,P_y)$ is on the shifted curve?
We start by shifting the point $P$ **left** by $a$; this of course gives the point $(P_x-a, P_y)$.
Next, we notice that $P$ is on the shifted curve if and only if
the left-shifted point is on the original curve.

asymptote:
    unitsize(1.5cm);

    real f(real x) { return x**2; }
    path G = graph(f, -2, 2);

    transform T = shift(4, 0);

    draw(inverse(T)*G, p=blue, L="original curve");
    draw(T*G, p=deepred, L="shifted curve");

    draw((-2,3)--(2,3), arrow=Arrow(5mm), L="shift right by $a$", align=N, p=deepgreen);
    draw((2,2.5)--(-2,2.5), arrow=Arrow(5mm), L="shift left by $a$", align=S, p=purple);

    dot(T*(1, 1), p=dotpen, L="$P$");
    dot(T*(2, 0), p=dotpen, L="$Q$");
    dot(inverse(T)*(1, 1), p=dotpen, L="$(P_x-a, P_y)$");
    dot(inverse(T)*(2, 0), p=dotpen, L="$(Q_x-a, Q_y)$");

If the original curve is given with an equation, then
the point $(P_x-a, P_y)$ is on that curve if and only if
replacing $x$ with $P_x-a$ and replacing $y$ with $P_y$ makes the equation true.

To find the equation of the shifted curve, we simply need to do this with the point $(x,y)$;
it is on the shifted curve if and only if $(x-a, y)$ is a point on the original curve,
which is true if and only if replacing $x$ with $x-a$ (and replacing $y$ with $y$, which does nothing)
satisfies the equation of the original curve.

    If $a$ is a positive number, then
    replacing $x$ with $x-a$ in the equation of a curve shifts the curve right by $a$.

It feels a bit weird that **subtracting** moves the curve **right**.
To make it feel intuitive, here's the same picture as in the beginning of this page,
with the parabola equations shown.
Try plugging in the points $(4,2)$ and $(9,2)$ to the equations
to see how replacing $x$ with $x-5$ really shifts right.

asymptote:
    unitsize(1.5cm);

    real f(real x) { return x**2 - 6*x + 10; }
    axises(-0.5, 10, -0.5, f(5));
    path G = graph(f, 1, 5);
    transform T = shift(5, 0);

    draw(G, p=blue);
    draw(T*G, p=deepred);

    label((1,5), L="$y=x^2-6x+10$", p=blue, align=cis(0.85));
    label(T*(1,5), L="$y=(x-5)^2-6(x-5)+10$", p=deepred, align=cis(0.85));

    pair P = (4,2);
    dot(P, L="$(" + string(P.x) + "," + string(P.y) + ")$", p=dotpen);
    dot(T*P, L="$(" + string((T*P).x) + "," + string((T*P).y) + ")$", p=dotpen);

How to shift a curve left?
Shifting left is cancelled by shifting right by the same amount, and in fact,
shifting left is the **only** thing that can be cancelled by shifting right.
So, if we find a way to do something to a curve so that shifting the result right gives the original curve,
then we have found a way to shift left.

If we first replace $x$ with $x + a$ and then replace $x$ with $x - a$,
then all occurrences of $x$ become first $x+a$ and then $(x-a)+a$;
that's same as just $x$, so we end up doing nothing.
By the above result, replacing $x$ with $x-a$ shifts the curve right by $a$.
So, we did something by replacing $x$ with $x+a$, and then shifted right to get the original curve back.

graybox:
    If $a$ is a positive number, then
    replacing $x$ with $x+a$ in the equation of a curve shifts the curve left by $a$.

If $a$ is negative, then we can write $a = -\abs{a}$.
Now
$$
x-a = x - (-\abs{a}) = x + \abs{a},
$$
so replacing $x$ with $x-a$ is same as replacing $x$ with $x+\abs{a}$.
In this sense, shifting a curve right by a negative number $a$ is same as shifting it left by $\abs{a}$.

graybox:
    If $a$ is a number, then replacing $x$ with $x-a$ in the equation of a curve
    <ul><li>
        shifts the curve right by $a$, if $a > 0$;
    </li><li>
        shifts the curve left by $\abs{a}$, if $a < 0$;
    </li><li>
        does nothing, if $a=0$.
    </li></ul>

Of course, we can do all the same steps with $y$ instead of $x$, and we get the following result that way.

graybox:
    If $a$ is a number, then replacing $y$ with $y-a$ in the equation of a curve
    <ul><li>
        shifts the curve up by $a$, if $a > 0$;
    </li><li>
        shifts the curve down by $\abs{a}$, if $a < 0$;
    </li><li>
        does nothing, if $a=0$.
    </li></ul>

There's another common way to shift curves up or down.
For example, to shift $y=x^2$ up by 3 units, you can do $y = x^2 + 3$;
to shift down, you would add a negative number (i.e. subtract a positive number).

asymptote:
    unitsize(1.5cm);
    axises(-2, 2, -1, 7);

    real f(real x) { return x**2; }
    draw(graph(f, -2, 2), L=Label("$y=x^2$", position=Relative(0.8)), p=blue, align=E);
    draw(shift(0, 3)*graph(f, -2, 2), L=Label("$y=x^2+3$", position=Relative(0.8)), p=deepred, align=E);

This follows from the above result, because according to that,
the equation of the shifted curve is whatever we get by replacing $y$ with $y-3$.
That gives $y-3 = x^2$, which can be written as $y = x^2 + 3$.

This works for any $y = f(x)$ curve,
where $f(x)$ is some expression containing the variable $x$ but not containing $y$.
However, this doesn't work for any curve;
if the equation of the curve can't be written in the form $y = f(x)$,
then we can't easily write $y = f(x) + 3$, even though we can easily replace $y$ with $y-3$.
