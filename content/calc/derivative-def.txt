# Definition of Derivative

To motivate the definition of derivative, we show several different examples.


## Walking speed

Let's say that you're walking along a line.
You might know that
$$
\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}.
$$
For example, if we move $3$ metres during $2$ seconds,
then the speed would be $\frac 3 2 = 1.5$ metres per second.
This is actually not quite right; the **average** speed is distance divided by time, $1.5$ metres per second,
but your actual speed might vary during those 2 seconds.

To approximate the actual speed, we can do the same thing with a small time interval.
For example, if we move $0.2$ metres during $0.1$ seconds,
then the average speed during the $0.1$ seconds is
$$
\frac{0.2\text{ metres}}{0.1\text{ seconds}} = 2\text{ metres per second},
$$
which measures your speed quite accurately.
To get the exact speed, we can do
$$
\text{speed} = \lim_{\text{time} \to 0} \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}.
$$
By definition of limit,
we can approximate the limit to any precision we want by measuring with a small enough time interval,
so it must be your speed.

Let $t$ denote time as seconds, and let $w(t)$ denote the distance that you have walked at time $t$.
Let $h$ be the length of the time interval (above we had examples with $h=2$ and $h=0.1$).
Consider the two moments at time $t$, and a little bit after it, at time $t+h$.
The corresponding walked distances are $w(t)$ and $w(t+h)$, so
the distance walked during the time interval is
$$
\text{distance} = w(t+h) - w(t).
$$
Plugging everything in, we get
$$
\text{speed}
= \lim_{\text{time} \to 0} \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}
= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{w(t+h)-w(t)}{h}.
$$
Here $h \to 0$ means that $h$ can be negative;
that means measuring the distance between a moment just a little bit before $t$ and the moment $t$.


## Download speed

Let's say that we are downloading a big file.
You might know that
$$
\text{downloading speed} = \frac{\text{amount of downloaded data}}{\text{time spent downloading}}.
$$
For example, if $3\text{MB}$ gets downloaded in $2$ seconds,
then the download speed would be $\frac 3 2 = 1.5$ megabytes per second.
This is not quite right; the **average** speed is amount of data divided by time, $1.5$ megabytes per second,
but the actual downloading speed might vary during those 2 seconds.

To approximate the actual downloading speed, we can do the same thing with a small time interval.
For example, if we download $0.2\text{MB}$ during $0.1$ seconds,
then the average downloading speed during the $0.1$ seconds is
$$
\frac{0.2\text{MB}}{0.1\text{ seconds}} = 2\text{MB per second},
$$
which measures the downloading speed quite accurately.
To get the exact speed, we can do
$$
\text{downloading speed} = \lim_{\text{time} \to 0} \frac{\text{amount of downloaded data}}{\text{time}}.
$$
By definition of limit,
we can approximate the limit to any precision we want by measuring with a small enough time interval,
so it must be the downloading speed.

Let $t$ denote time as seconds, and let $D(t)$ denote the amount of data downloaded at time $t$.
Let $h$ be the length of the time interval (above we had examples with $h=2$ and $h=0.1$).
Consider the two moments at time $t$, and a little bit after it, at time $t+h$.
The corresponding amounts of downloaded data are $D(t)$ and $D(t+h)$, so
the data downloaded during the time interval is
$$
\text{amount of downloaded data} = D(t+h) - D(t).
$$
Plugging everything in, we get
$$
\begin{align}
\text{downloading speed}
&= \lim_{\text{time} \to 0} \frac{\text{amount of downloaded data}}{\text{time}} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{D(t+h) - D(t)}{h}.
\end{align}
$$
Here $h \to 0$ means that $h$ can be negative;
that means calculating the amount of data downloaded
between a moment just a little bit before $t$ and the moment $t$.


## Slope of tangent line

Let's say that we want to find the tangent line of the parabola $y = x^2$ at the point $(1,1)$.

asymptote:
    unitsize(1.5cm);
    axises(-3, 3, -1, 9);

    real f(real x) { return x**2; }
    real g(real x) { return 1 + 2*(x-1); }
    draw(graph(f, -3, 3), p=blue, L=Label("$y=x^2$", position=Relative(0.9)), align=W);
    draw(graph(g, 0.1, 3.5), p=deepred,
        L=rrotate(atan(2))*Label("tangent line", position=Relative(0.7)), align=E);

    dot((1,1), p=dotpen, L="$(1,1)$");

To find the equation of a tangent line,
we only need to find its slope;
once we have the slope, we can plug that and the point $(1,1)$ into
[this result](../analytic-plane-geometry/line-eq-slope-and-point.html).

[We know](../analytic-plane-geometry/line-eq-slope.html#meaning-of-s-and-h) that
if we have a tangent line, then any nonzero vector $\vec d$ along the tangent line
gives the slope as $\frac{d_y}{d_x}$.
We can't find a vector like that easily,
but we can instead consider a vector between $(1,1)$ and some other point $P$ on the graph.

asymptote:
    unitsize(1.5cm);
    axises(-3, 3, -1, 9);

    real f(real x) { return x**2; }
    real g(real x) { return 1 + 2*(x-1); }
    pair P = (2.9, f(2.9));

    draw(graph(f, -3, 3), p=blue, L=Label("$y=x^2$", position=Relative(0.9)), align=W);
    draw(graph(g, 0.1, 3.5), p=deepred);
    draw((1,1)--P, arrow=Arrow(4mm), p=deepgreen, L="$\vec v$", align=W);

    dot((1,1), p=dotpen, L="$(1,1)$");
    dot(P, p=dotpen, L="$P$");

If we do $\frac{v_y}{v_x}$, we don't quite get the slope of the tangent line
because $\vec v$ doesn't go in the direction of the tangent line.
However, if the point $P$ is near $(1,1)$,
then $\vec v$ goes almost in the direction of the tangent line and $\frac{v_y}{v_x}$ is almost equal to the slope:

asymptote:
    unitsize(1.5cm);
    axises(-3, 3, -1, 9);

    real f(real x) { return x**2; }
    real g(real x) { return 1 + 2*(x-1); }
    pair P = (1.4, f(1.4));

    draw(graph(f, -3, 3), p=blue, L=Label("$y=x^2$", position=Relative(0.9)), align=W);
    draw(graph(g, 0.1, 3.5), p=deepred);
    draw((1,1)--P, arrow=Arrow(4mm), p=deepgreen, L="$\vec v$", align=W);

    dot((1,1), p=dotpen, L="$(1,1)$");
    dot(P, p=dotpen, L="$P$");

To get the exact slope, we can take a limit of $\frac{v_y}{v_x}$
with the point $P$ approaching the point $(1,1)$.
We can approximate the slope of the tangent line to any precision we want
by bringing $P$ close enough to $(1,1)$,
so by definition of limit, the slope of the tangent line is the limit.

Let $h = v_x$.
Then the $x$ coordinate of $P$ is $1+h$, and because $P$ is a point on the graph $y=x^2$,
the $y$ coordinate is $(1+h)^2$.
This means that
$$
v_y = (1+h)^2 - 1,
$$
so
$$
\frac{v_y}{v_x} = \frac{(1+h)^2 - 1}{h}.
$$
To bring the points closer to each other, we can take a limit with $h \to 0$,
because $h$ is the difference of the $x$ coordinates of the points:
$$
\text{slope of tangent line} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(1+h)^2 - 1^2}{h}
$$
Calculating this limit is straight-forward
(expand the top, cancel a lot of things and then use [limit properties](limit-props.html)).


## The definition

All of the above examples resulted in a limit of the form
$$
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h},
$$
where $a$ was some number and $f$ was some function.
Now we give a name for limits like this; this is the **derivative** of $f$ at $a$.
So, when you are learning to calculate derivatives,
you simultaneously learn to calculate
speeds of moving objects, downloading speeds, tangent line slopes and
many other things that can be described with a derivative.

For example, let $f(x) = x^2$. The derivative of $f$ at any number $a$ is
$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(a+h)^2 - a^2}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{a^2 + 2ah + h^2 - a^2}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2ah + h^2}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} (2a + h) \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} 2a + \lim_{h \to 0} h = 2a.
\end{align}
$$
Here are several ways to interpret the result:
<ul><li>
    A tangent line of the graph $y=x^2$ going through the point $(a, a^2)$ has slope $2a$.
</li><li>
    If your location at $t$ seconds is $t^2$ metres,
    then your speed at any time $t$ is $2t$ metres per second.
</li><li>
    If the amount of data downloaded at $t$ seconds is $t^2$ megabytes,
    then the downloading speed at any time $t$ is $2t$ megabytes per second.
</li></ul>
