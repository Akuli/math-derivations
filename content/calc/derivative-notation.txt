# Notation for Derivatives

So far we haven't used any notation for the derivative;
we have just said that the derivative of $f$ at $a$ is
$$
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.
$$
We will use derivatives a lot, so we need some notation.


## Lagrange's Notation

We write the derivative of a function $f$ at $a$ as
$$
f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.
$$
This is called Lagrange's notation.

With this notation, you can think of $f'$ itself as a thing;
it's a function that takes in a number, and outputs the derivative of $f$ at that number.
Often the function $f'$ is called the derivative of $f$.

So, to write [this result of the previous derivation](derivative-simple.html#derivative-of-x-2),
we can let $f(x) = x^2$ and then say $f'(x) = 2x$.
This isn't bad, but we will do this a lot,
so I'll show you a way to write this without having to define a function.


## Leibniz's Notation

We can write the derivative of $x^2$ like
$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^2 = 2x.
$$
This is called Leibniz's notation.
So, $\frac{d}{dx}$ sees whatever you put in front of it as $\text{function}(x)$,
and then gives you $\text{function}'(x)$.

The above notation is actually a shorthand for
$$
\frac{d(x^2)}{dx} = 2x.
$$
A long time ago, $d(x^2)$ was an infinitely small difference of $x^2$ values, given by
$$
d(x^2) = (x + \text{infinitely small number})^2 - x^2,
$$
and similarly, $dx$ was an infinitely small difference of $x$ values.
Then $\frac{d(x^2)}{dx}$ was just two infinitely small numbers divided by each other.
Nowadays we have limits instead of infinitely small numbers, and the derivative is more than division;
it's a limit of whatever the division gives.
The notation is still being used though.

Leibniz's notation can be useful for "checking" some derivative results.
For example, with Leibniz's notation, the derivative of $x$ is
$$
\frac{d}{dx} x = \frac{dx}{dx},
$$
which looks like it really should be $1$, and indeed it is $1$
like we saw [here](derivative-simple.html#derivative-of-constant).
