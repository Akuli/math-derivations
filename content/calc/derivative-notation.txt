# Notation for Derivatives

We will use derivatives a lot, so we introduce notation for derivatives.


## Lagrange's notation

We write the derivative of a function $f$ at $a$ as
$$
f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.
$$
This is called Lagrange's notation.
So, to write the result of [the last example on the previous page](derivative-def.html#the-definition),
we can let $f(x) = x^2$ and then say $f'(x) = 2x$.

With this notation, you can think of $f'$ itself as a thing;
it's a function that takes in a number, and outputs the derivative of $f$ at that number.
Often the function $f'$ is called the derivative of $f$.


## Leibniz's notation

We can also write
$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^2 = 2x.
$$
This is called Leibniz's notation, and
it can be handy because we didn't need to define a function just to talk about the derivative of $x^2$.
So, $\frac{d}{dx}$ sees whatever you put in front of it as $\text{function}(x)$,
and then gives you $\text{function}'(x)$;
that is,
$$
\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = f'(x).
$$

The $\frac{d}{dx} x^2$ is actually a shorthand for $\frac{d(x^2)}{dx}$, with $x^2$ on the top like that.
Originally $d(x^2)$ was an infinitely small difference of $x^2$ values, given by
$$
d(x^2) = (x + \text{infinitely small number})^2 - x^2,
$$
and similarly, $dx$ was an infinitely small difference of $x$ values.
Then $\frac{d(x^2)}{dx}$ was just two infinitely small numbers divided by each other.
Nowadays we have limits instead of infinitely small numbers, and the derivative is more than division;
it's a limit of whatever the division gives.
The notation is still being used though.
