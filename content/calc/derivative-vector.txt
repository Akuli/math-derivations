# Derivative of a Vector-valued Function

Let $\vec v$ be a vector-valued function.
If we just try to apply the definition of derivative to it, we get
$$
\vec v'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\vec v(t+h) - \vec v(t)}{h}.
$$
This works, although the meanings of the operations involved change a bit.
On the top, we are now subtracting vectors instead of numbers, and the result is a vector.
When we divide by $h$, we divide a vector by a number, which results in a vector,
so we end up taking a [limit of a vector](limit-vector.html).
Just like before, we call this the derivative of $v$, and we write
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \vec v(t) = \vec v'(t),
$$
although now we use $t$ instead of $x$ everywhere, so we have $\frac{d}{dt}$ instead of $\frac{d}{dx}$.

The physical meaning of this derivative is similar to the derivative of a real-valued function;
if $\vec v(t)$ is the location of an object at time $t$, thought of as a point in space,
then $\vec v'(t)$ is the velocity vector,
indicating in which direction and how fast the object is moving.
To see why, do [the things that we did with real-valued functions](derivative-def.html),
replacing the walked distance with a vector representing the location.
It's very common to use the letter $\vec v$ for the velocity vector,
and some other letter such as $\vec r$ for the location.


## Taking derivatives of $\I$ and $\J$ parts separately

Let $\vec v(t) = (f(t), g(t))$.
With the definition of derivative, we get
$$
\begin{align}
\vec v'(t)
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\vec v(t+h) - \vec v(t)}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(f(t+h), g(t+h)) - (f(t), g(t))}{h}.
\end{align}
$$
Let's switch to using the $\I$ and $\J$ notation of vectors. Now we get
$$
\begin{align}
\vec v'(t)
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{( f(t+h)\I + g(t+h)\J ) - ( f(t)\I + g(t)\J )}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(t+h)\I + g(t+h)\J - f(t)\I - g(t)\J}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(f(t+h) - f(t))\I + (g(t+h) - g(t))\J}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \left( \frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h}\I + \frac{g(t+h) - g(t)}{h}\J \right).
\end{align}
$$
By [taking limits of $\I$ and $\J$ parts
separately](limit-vector.html#taking-limits-of-i-and-j-parts-separately), we get
$$
\vec v'(t)
= \underbrace{\left( \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h} \right)}_{f'(t)}\I
+ \underbrace{\left( \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{g(t+h) - g(t)}{h} \right)}_{g'(t)}\J.
$$
So, we can not only calculate any limit of a vector-valued function as two limits of real-valued functions,
but also calculate any derivative of a vector-valued function as two derivatives of real-valued functions.
Here the derivative $\vec v'(t)$ exists if and only if $f'(t)$ and $g'(t)$ exist;
this follows from the "if and only if" in the result for taking limits of $\I$ and $\J$ parts separately.

graybox:
    Let $f$ and $g$ be real-valued functions.
    Then the derivative $\frac{d}{dt} (f(t),g(t))$ exists
    if and only if $\frac{d}{dt} f(t)$ and $\frac{d}{dt} g(t)$ exist,
    and in that case, we have
    $$
    \frac{d}{dt} (f(t),g(t)) = \left( \frac{d}{dt} f(t), ~ \frac{d}{dt} g(t) \right).
    $$
