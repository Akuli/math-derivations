# Definition of Limit

insert-function-warning-here

[On the previous page](limit-intro.html),
we "defined" limits by plugging in nearby numbers.
For example, to calculate $\lim_{x \to 3} f(x)$,
we calculated things like $f(3.00001)$.

There were several problems with this approach.
On this page we fix them by defining limits precisely.
**This is not easy.**

That said, I have tried to make this as easy as possible.
In my opinion, this approach is much easier
than the standard way to teach the definition.
If you want to learn the standard way instead,
just go study mathematics in any university.


## Defining small functions

Usually "small" doesn't mean anything specific in mathematics,
but in this context it's convenient to assign a meaning to it.

The purpose of introducing small functions
is to make the definition of limit easier.
Traditionally, smallness is baked into the definition of limit,
so it becomes one big mess that is hard to understand and work with.
I don't want that.

An open interval is **centered around $a$** if it's $(a-r, a+r)$ for some $r > 0$.
For example, $(4,6)$ is an interval centered around $5$.

Suppose $f$ is a function whose values are not negative.
We say that $f$ is **small near $a$**,
if for any positive "bound number" $b > 0$,
we have $f(x) < b$ on some interval centered around $a$, excluding the midpoint $a$.
The excluding means that we don't care about what $f(a)$ is;
we only consider inputs around the number $a$, not exactly at $a$.

Here are some examples to clarify this.

<ul><li>
The function $f(x)=(x-1)^2$ is small near $1$.
In the picture below, I have chosen the bound number $b=0.1$,
and indeed, the function is below that bound on some interval centered around 1,
marked in green.
(We could calculate what exactly that interval is, but it's not important.)
The same works for any positive bound number
because the graph is a [parabola](../analytic-plane-geometry/parabola.html)
whose peak is at $(1,0)$.

asymptote:
    unitsize(3cm);
    draw((1-sqrt(0.1),0)--(1+sqrt(0.1),0), p=green+5);
    axises(-0.5,3,-0.5,2.5);
    real f(real x) { return (x-1)^2; }
    draw(graph(f, -0.5, 2.5), p=blue, L=Label("$y=(x-1)^2$", position=Relative(0.8), align=E));
    draw((-0.5,0.1)--(3,0.1), L=Label("$y=0.1$", align=N, position=Relative(0.8)), p=gray+smalldashes);
    dot((1,0), L="$(1,0)$", p=dotpen, align=S);

Here is a zoomed-in view:

asymptote:
    unitsize(10cm);
    draw((1-sqrt(0.1),0)--(1+sqrt(0.1),0), p=green+5);
    axises(0.5,1.5,0,0);
    real f(real x) { return (x-1)^2; }
    draw(graph(f, 0.5, 1.5), p=blue);
    draw((0.5,0.1)--(1.5,0.1), p=gray+smalldashes);
    dot((1,0), L="$(1,0)$", p=dotpen, align=S);

</li><li>
The function $f(x)=\frac{(x-1)^3}{x-1}$ is same as the previous function,
except that $f(1)$ is undefined.
This means that the graph has a hole at $x=1$.
However, smallness is defined so that $f(1)$ is ignored,
so this function is also small near $1$.

asymptote:
    unitsize(10cm);
    draw((1-sqrt(0.1),0)--(1+sqrt(0.1),0), p=green+5);
    real f(real x) { return (x-1)^2; }
    draw(graph(f, 0.5, 0.985), p=blue);
    draw(graph(f, 1.015, 1.5), p=blue);
    draw((0.5,0.1)--(1.5,0.1), p=gray+smalldashes);

</li><li>
The function $f(x)=x^2$ is small near zero similarly to the previous examples,
but it is not small near 2.
This is because $f(x) > 4$ whenever $x > 2$.
Any interval centered around 2 will contain numbers greater than 2,
so we can't make the function smaller than the bound number $b=4$.

asymptote:
    unitsize(2cm);
    draw((2.2,0)--(2.2,2.2^2), p=lightgreen+smalldashes, align=S);
    draw((1.7,0)--(2.3,0), p=green+5);
    axises(-0.5,3,-0.5,6);
    real f(real x) { return x^2; }
    draw(graph(f, -0.5, sqrt(6)), p=blue, L=Label("$y=x^2$", position=Relative(0.5), align=W));
    draw((-0.5,4)--(3.5,4), L=Label("$y=4$", align=N, position=Relative(0.9)), p=gray+smalldashes);
    dot((2,4), L="$(2,4)$", p=dotpen, align=NW);
    dot((2,0), L="$2$", p=dotpen, align=S);

For bound numbers greater than 4, it is possible to choose a small enough interval,
but smallness would mean that we can fit the function below **any** positive bound number.

</li><li>
The function $f(x)=0.0001$ is not small near any number.
For example, it's not possible to make it go below the bound $b=0.00000001$.
The same goes for any function that always outputs the same positive number.

</li><li>
The function $f(x)=0$ is small near any number. You can pick any interval centered around the number.

</li></ul>

If the function may get negative values,
we need to ignore the negativity (that is, take the absolute value).
For example, $-x^2$ is small near zero because $x^2$ is small near zero.
Thus we arrive at the following definition of smallness.

graybox:
    A function $f$ is **small near** a number $a$, if for any $b>0$
    (called the "bound number"),
    there is some interval centered around $a$ such that
    $|f(x)| < b$ on the interval excluding the midpoint $a$.

Instead of $|f(x)| < b$, we could also write $-b < f(x) < b$.
It means the same thing.


## The Definition

[On the previous page](limit-intro.html), we noticed that
$$
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^3-1}{x-1} = 3
$$
by plugging in numbers like this:
<table><tr>
    <th>$x$</th>
    <th>$\frac{x^3-1}{x-1}$</th>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1$</td><td>undefined</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.1$</td><td>$3.31000\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.01$</td><td>$3.03010\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.001$</td><td>$3.00300\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.0001$</td><td>$3.00030\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.00001$</td><td>$3.00003\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.9$</td><td>$2.71000\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.99$</td><td>$2.97010\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.999$</td><td>$2.99700\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.9999$</td><td>$2.99970\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.99999$</td><td>$2.99997\dots$</td>
</tr></table>

Subtracting 3 from the values of the function gives us small numbers.

<table><tr>
    <th>$x$</th>
    <th>$\frac{x^3-1}{x-1} - 3$</th>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1$</td><td>undefined</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.1$</td><td>$0.31000\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.01$</td><td>$0.03010\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.001$</td><td>$0.00300\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.0001$</td><td>$0.00030\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.00001$</td><td>$0.00003\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.9$</td><td>$-0.29000\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.99$</td><td>$-0.02990\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.999$</td><td>$-0.00299\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.9999$</td><td>$-0.00029\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.99999$</td><td>$-0.00002\dots$</td>
</tr></table>

This makes sense: "close to $3$" is same as "difference to 3 is small".
Because we have defined precisely what small means,
we can use this idea to define limits:

graybox:
    We say that function $f$ has **limit** $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$ and we write
    $$
    \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L,
    $$
    if $f(x)-L$ is a small function near $a$.

Because we defined precisely what small means,
there's nothing vague in this definition,
and it's possible to write convincing proofs and derivations based on it.

By noticing that $f(x)-L=\text{small}$ can be rewritten as $f(x)=L+\text{small}$,
we arrive with the following alternative way to write the definition:

graybox:
    We say that a function $f$ has **limit** $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$ and we write
    $$
    \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L,
    $$
    if
    $$
    f(x) = L + (\text{some function that is small near $a$}).
    $$

In other words, if we look at the function near $a$,
its value is close to $L$, but with a small error.
That error (the small function) may be positive or negative.


## How to explain smallness to others

By plugging in $L=0$ into the definition of limit, we see that
$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = 0$ is same as the function $f$ itself
being small near $a$.

graybox:
    A function $f$ is small near $a$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = 0$Â·

This should make sense.
Limit zero means you get values near zero if you plug in numbers near $a$.
Smallness means you can make the function smaller than any positive bound
on some interval centered around $a$.
These are different ways to express the same thing.

This is an easy way to explain what the "smallness" means
when you discuss the content of this page
with someone who learned limits elsewhere.
You can just say: smallness means the limit is zero.
