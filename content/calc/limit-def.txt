# Definition of Limit

insert-function-warning-here

So far, we have
["defined" limits by plugging in nearby numbers](limit-intro.html).
There were several problems with this approach.

On this page we fix them by defining limits precisely.
We use [smallness as defined on the previous page](limit-small.html)
to simplify this.
In my opinion, this approach is much easier
than the standard way to teach the definition of limit.
If you want to learn the standard way instead,
just go study mathematics in any university.

The tl;dr is: limit means that the difference from the limit value is small.


## The Definition

[On the previous page](limit-intro.html), we noticed that
$$
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^3-1}{x-1} = 3
$$
by plugging in numbers like this:
<table><tr>
    <th>$x$</th>
    <th>$\frac{x^3-1}{x-1}$</th>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1$</td><td>undefined</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.1$</td><td>$3.31000\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.01$</td><td>$3.03010\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.001$</td><td>$3.00300\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.0001$</td><td>$3.00030\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.00001$</td><td>$3.00003\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.9$</td><td>$2.71000\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.99$</td><td>$2.97010\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.999$</td><td>$2.99700\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.9999$</td><td>$2.99970\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.99999$</td><td>$2.99997\dots$</td>
</tr></table>

Subtracting 3 from the values of the function gives us small numbers.

<table><tr>
    <th>$x$</th>
    <th>$\frac{x^3-1}{x-1} - 3$</th>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1$</td><td>undefined</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.1$</td><td>$0.31000\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.01$</td><td>$0.03010\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.001$</td><td>$0.00300\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.0001$</td><td>$0.00030\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$1.00001$</td><td>$0.00003\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.9$</td><td>$-0.29000\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.99$</td><td>$-0.02990\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.999$</td><td>$-0.00299\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.9999$</td><td>$-0.00029\dots$</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>$0.99999$</td><td>$-0.00002\dots$</td>
</tr></table>

This makes sense: "close to $3$" is same as "difference to 3 is small".
Wse can use this idea to define limits:

graybox:
    We say that function $f$ has **limit** $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$ and we write
    $$
    \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L,
    $$
    if $f(x)-L$ is a small function near $a$.

Because we defined precisely what small means,
there's nothing vague in this definition,
and it's possible to write convincing proofs and derivations based on it.

By noticing that $f(x)-L=\text{small}$ can be rewritten as $f(x)=L+\text{small}$,
we arrive with the following alternative way to write the definition:

graybox:
    We say that a function $f$ has **limit** $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$ and we write
    $$
    \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L,
    $$
    if
    $$
    f(x) = L + (\text{some function that is small near $a$}).
    $$

In other words, if we look at the function near $a$,
its value is close to $L$, but with a small error.
That error (the small function) may be positive or negative.


## How to explain smallness to others

By plugging in $L=0$ into the definition of limit, we see that
$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = 0$ is same as the function $f$ itself
being small near $a$.

graybox:
    A function $f$ is small near $a$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = 0$Â·

This should make sense.
Limit zero means you get values near zero if you plug in numbers near $a$.
Smallness means you can make the function smaller than any positive bound
on some interval centered around $a$.
These are different ways to express the same thing.

This is an easy way to explain what the "smallness" means
when you discuss the content of this page
with someone who learned limits elsewhere.
You can just say: smallness means the limit is zero.
