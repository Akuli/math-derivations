# Inequality and Limit

Suppose that $f(x) \le g(x)$ for all numbers $x$ except $a$,
and suppose that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = A$ and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = B$.
Let's see what we can say about $A$ and $B$.
It seems reasonable to expect $A \le B$,
so let's see what happens if that's false, and we have $A > B$ instead.

Let $D=A-B$ denote the difference of the limits $A$ and $B$.
We have $A > B$, so $D$ is positive.
By the definitions of the limits,
there's an input interval of $f$ corresponding to the output interval $(A-\frac{D}{3}, A+\frac{D}{3})$,
and there's an input interval of $g$ corresponding to the output interval $(B-\frac{D}{3}, B+\frac{D}{3})$Â·

Just like [before](limit-basics.html#more-than-one-limit), the input intervals overlap,
and there are numbers not equal to $a$ that are in both of the input intervals.
Letting $o$ be one of these "overlap numbers", we get
$$
f(o) \in \left( A-\frac{D}{3}, A+\frac{D}{3} \right), \qquad
g(o) \in \left( B-\frac{D}{3}, B+\frac{D}{3} \right).
$$
This leads to
$$
f(o) > g(o),
$$
which is impossible; we assumed that $f(x) \le g(x)$ whenever $x \ne a$, and we also have $o \ne a$.

We didn't even need the assumption that $f(x) \le g(x)$ for **all** $x$.
Instead, it was enough that we found one overlap number, which gave the desired result.
Instead of assuming that $f(x) \le g(x)$ for all $x$,
we could assume that there's some open interval $I$ centered around $a$ in which $f(x) \le g(x)$;
then we can choose $o$ such that it's in both input intervals and in $I$.

    draw((-1,0)--(6,0), arrow=Arrow(5mm));
    draw((1,-0.1)--(3,-0.1), p=deepred+5);
    draw((0.5,-0.2)--(3.5,-0.2), p=darkorange+5);
    draw((0,0)--(4,0), p=deepgreen+5, L=Label("$I$", align=N, position=Relative(0.8)));

    dot((2,0), p=dotpen+blue, L="$a$", align=N);

graybox:
    If $f(x) \le g(x)$ for all numbers $x$ in some open interval centered around $a$,
    and the limits $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x)$ exist,
    then $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) \le \lim_{x \to b} g(x)$.

Note that $f(x) < g(x)$ does **not** imply $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) < \lim_{x \to a} g(x)$.
For example, let $f(x) = 0$ and
$$
g(x) = \begin{cases}
    x, & \text{if $x>0$}; \\
    7, & \text{if $x=0$}; \\
    -x, & \text{if $x<0$}.
\end{cases}
$$

asymptote:
    unitsize(1cm);

    draw(graph(abs, -6, -0.1), p=blue);
    draw(graph(abs, 0.1, 6), p=blue, L=rotate(45)*Label("$y=g(x)$", position=Relative(0.8)));
    draw((-6,0)--(6,0), p=deepred, L=Label("$y=f(x)$", position=Relative(0.8)), align=N);
    dot((0, 7), p=blue+4, L="$g(0)=7$");

Now we have $f(x) < g(x)$ for all $x$. We get
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 0} 0 = 0.
$$
By calculating [left and right limits](limit-1sided.html), we get
$$
\begin{align}
&\lim_{x \to 0^+} g(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} x = 0 \\
&\lim_{x \to 0^-} g(x)
    = \lim_{x \to 0^-} -x
    = \underbrace{\left( \lim_{x \to 0^-} -1 \right)}_{-1} \, \underbrace{\left( \lim_{x \to 0^-} x \right)}_0
    = 0,
\end{align}
$$
which shows that $\lim_{x \to 0} g(x)$ is also $0$.
So, even though $f(x) < g(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, the limits of $f$ and $g$ are equal.
This means that the graphs go very close to each other, but they never quite touch.
