# Small functions

Usually "small" doesn't mean anything specific in mathematics,
but in this context it's convenient to assign a meaning to it.

The purpose of introducing small functions
is to make the definition of limit easier.
Traditionally, smallness is baked into the definition of limit,
so it becomes one big mess that is hard to understand and work with.
I don't want that.


## Definition

An open interval is **centered around $a$** if it's $(a-r, a+r)$ for some $r > 0$.
For example, $(4,6)$ is an interval centered around $5$.

Suppose $f$ is a function whose values are not negative.
We say that $f$ is **small near $a$**,
if for any positive "bound number" $b > 0$,
we have $f(x) < b$ on some interval centered around $a$, excluding the center $a$.
The excluding means that we don't care about what $f(a)$ is;
we only consider inputs around the number $a$, not exactly at $a$.

Here are some examples to clarify this.

<ul><li>
The function $f(x)=(x-1)^2$ is small near $1$.
In the picture below, I have chosen the bound number $b=0.1$,
and indeed, the function is below that bound on some interval centered around 1,
marked in green.
(We could calculate what exactly that interval is, but it's not important.)
The same works for any positive bound number
because the graph is a [parabola](../analytic-plane-geometry/parabola.html)
whose peak is at $(1,0)$.

asymptote:
    unitsize(3cm);
    draw((1-sqrt(0.1),0)--(1+sqrt(0.1),0), p=green+5);
    axises(-0.5,3,-0.5,2.5);
    real f(real x) { return (x-1)^2; }
    draw(graph(f, -0.5, 2.5), p=blue, L=Label("$y=(x-1)^2$", position=Relative(0.8), align=E));
    draw((-0.5,0.1)--(3,0.1), L=Label("$y=0.1$", align=N, position=Relative(0.8)), p=gray+smalldashes);
    dot((1,0), L="$(1,0)$", p=dotpen, align=S);

Here is a zoomed-in view:

asymptote:
    unitsize(10cm);
    draw((1-sqrt(0.1),0)--(1+sqrt(0.1),0), p=green+5);
    axises(0.5,1.5,0,0);
    real f(real x) { return (x-1)^2; }
    draw(graph(f, 0.5, 1.5), p=blue);
    draw((0.5,0.1)--(1.5,0.1), p=gray+smalldashes);
    dot((1,0), L="$(1,0)$", p=dotpen, align=S);

</li><li>
The function $f(x)=\frac{(x-1)^3}{x-1}$ is same as the previous function,
except that $f(1)$ is undefined.
This means that the graph has a hole at $x=1$.
However, smallness is defined so that $f(1)$ is ignored,
so this function is also small near $1$.

asymptote:
    unitsize(10cm);
    draw((1-sqrt(0.1),0)--(1+sqrt(0.1),0), p=green+5);
    real f(real x) { return (x-1)^2; }
    draw(graph(f, 0.5, 0.985), p=blue);
    draw(graph(f, 1.015, 1.5), p=blue);
    draw((0.5,0.1)--(1.5,0.1), p=gray+smalldashes);

</li><li>
The function $f(x)=x^2$ is small near zero similarly to the previous examples,
but it is not small near 2.
This is because $f(x) > 4$ whenever $x > 2$.
Any interval centered around 2 will contain numbers greater than 2,
so we can't make the function smaller than the bound number $b=4$.

asymptote:
    unitsize(2cm);
    draw((2.2,0)--(2.2,2.2^2), p=lightgreen+smalldashes, align=S);
    draw((1.7,0)--(2.3,0), p=green+5);
    axises(-0.5,3,-0.5,6);
    real f(real x) { return x^2; }
    draw(graph(f, -0.5, sqrt(6)), p=blue, L=Label("$y=x^2$", position=Relative(0.5), align=W));
    draw((-0.5,4)--(3.5,4), L=Label("$y=4$", align=N, position=Relative(0.9)), p=gray+smalldashes);
    dot((2,4), L="$(2,4)$", p=dotpen, align=NW);
    dot((2,0), L="$2$", p=dotpen, align=S);

For bound numbers greater than 4, it is possible to choose a small enough interval,
but smallness would mean that we can fit the function below **any** positive bound number.

</li><li>
The function $f(x)=0.0001$ is not small near any number.
For example, it's not possible to make it go below the bound $b=0.00000001$.
The same goes for any function that always outputs the same positive number.

</li><li>
The function $f(x)=0$ is small near any number. You can pick any interval centered around the number.

</li></ul>

If the function may get negative values,
we need to ignore the negativity (that is, take the absolute value).
For example, $-x^2$ is small near zero because $x^2$ is small near zero.
Thus we arrive at the following definition of smallness.

graybox:
    A function $f$ is **small near** a number $a$, if for any $b>0$
    (called the "bound number"),
    there is some interval centered around $a$ such that
    $|f(x)| < b$ on the interval excluding the center $a$.

Instead of $|f(x)| < b$, we could instead write $-b < f(x) < b$.
It means the same thing.

graybox:
    A function $f$ is **small near** a number $a$, if for any $b>0$
    (called the "bound number"),
    there is some interval centered around $a$ such that
    $-b < f(x) < b$ on the interval excluding the center $a$.

Traditionally the bound number is denoted by the greek letter $\varepsilon$ (epsilon).
I chose $b$ for this site,
because it is easier to remember "$b$ is the bound number"
than "$\varepsilon$ is the bound number".


## Multiplying by constant

We show that if $f(x)$ is small near 3, then $5f(x)$ is also small near 3.

At first this seems wrong.
For example, consider the bound $b=0.1$.
If $|f(x)| < 0.1$,
we don't necessarily have $|5f(x)| < 0.1$.
If, for example, $f(x)=0.09$ (or $-0.09$), then $|5f(x)| = 0.45$.

However, we **can** conclude that $|5f(x)| < 0.5$.
This means that $f(x)$ can be made smaller than the bound $b=0.5$.

The trick is to make $f(x)$ smaller than one fifth of the desired bound $b$,
so that once multiplied by 5, the result is surely smaller than $b$.
For example, if you want $5f(x)$ to be smaller than $0.1$,
then require $f(x)$ to be smaller than $0.02$.

Specifically, here's how we can prove that $5f(x)$ is small:

* Let $b$ be any positive bound number.
* Because $\frac{b}{5}$ is a positive number and $f(x)$ is small near 3,
    we can use $\frac{b}{5}$ as a bound number,
    so there is an interval $I$ centered around $3$ such that $|f(x)| < \frac{b}{5}$
    on the interval $I$ excluding the center $3$.
* Multiplying by 5 gives $5|f(x)| < b$ on the same interval $I$ excluding the center $3$.
* Because 5 is a positive number, we can just as well write it inside the absolute value,
    so $|5f(x)| < b$ on the interval $I$ excluding the center $3$.

Because this works for any bound $b$, it shows that $5f(x)$ is small near 3.

This works with any other number instead of $3$.
We can also replace 5 with any other positive number.

graybox:
    If $c$ is a positive constant and $f(x)$ is a function that is small near some number $a$,
    then $cf(x)$ is also small near $a$.

Here "constant" means any number that does not depend on $x$,
such as $3$ or $-72.6$.

This is actually not limited to positive values of $c$:

* If $c=0$, then $cf(x) = 0$ for any $x$. That is a small function.
* If $c=-1$, then $cf(x) = -f(x)$ is a small function,
    because definition of smallness only uses the absolute value $|f(x)|$,
    and adding a minus in front doesn't affect it.
* If $c=-5$, we can write $cf(x)$ as $5(-f(x))$, where $-f(x)$ is a small function,
    and by the above result, $5(-f(x))$ is also a small function.
    The same works for any negative $c$.

graybox:
    If $c$ is a constant and $f(x)$ is a function that is small near some number $a$,
    then $cf(x)$ is also small near $a$.


## Sum of small functions

(In this derivation, it's easier to use the $-b < f(x) < b$ version of the definition
than the original $|f(x)| < b$ version.)

Suppose that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are small near $a$.
We show that their sum $f(x)+g(x)$ is also small near $a$.

At first this seems wrong.
For example, consider the bound $b=0.1$.
If $-0.1 < f(x) < 0.1$ and $-0.1 < g(x) < 0.1$,
we don't necessarily have $-0.1 < f(x)+g(x) < 0.1$.
If, for example, $f(x)=0.09$ and $g(x)=0.09$, the sum will be $0.18$.

However, we **can** conclude that $-0.2 < f(x)+g(x) < 0.2$
by simply adding the inequalities together:
$$
(-0.1) + (-0.1) < f(x) + g(x) < 0.1 + 0.1
$$
This means that $f(x)+g(x)$ can be made smaller than the bound $b=0.2$.
The trick is to make $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ smaller than half of the desired bound $b$,
so that once added, the result is surely smaller than $b$.

For this to work, $x$ must be close enough to $a$ for both bounds to work.
Specifically, we have

* something like $-0.1 < f(x) < 0.1$ on an interval $I_f$ excluding its center $a$
* something like $-0.1 < g(x) < 0.1$ on an interval $I_g$ excluding its center $a$,

The number $x$ must be in **both** of the intervals $I_f$ and $I_g$.
The intervals look like this:

asymptote:
    unitsize(2cm);

    draw((0,0)--(5,0), arrow=Arrow(5mm));
    draw((1,0.1)--(3,0.1), p=deepred+5);
    label(position=(2.5,0.1), L="$I_f$", align=N, p=deepred);
    draw((0.5,-0.1)--(3.5,-0.1), p=darkorange+5, L="$I_g$", align=S);

    label(position=(2,1), L="$a$", align=N, p=blue);
    draw((2,1)--(2,0.2), arrow=Arrow(4mm), p=blue);
    dot((2,0), p=dotpen+blue);

Let $I$ denote whichever of $I_f$ and $I_g$ is smaller (in the picture, $I=I_f$).
Then the other interval includes $I$,
so it's enough to require $x$ to be in $I$.
This ensures that it's in both intervals.

Specifically, here's how we can prove that $f(x)+g(x)$ is small near $a$:

* Let $b$ be any positive bound number.
* Because $\frac{b}{2}$ is a positive number and $f(x)$ is a small function,
    we can use $\frac{b}{2}$ as a bound number,
    so there is an interval $I_f$ centered around $a$
    such that $-\frac{b}{2} < f(x) < \frac{b}{2}$
    on the interval $I_f$ excluding the center $a$.
* Because $\frac{b}{2}$ is a positive number and $g(x)$ is a small function,
    we can use $\frac{b}{2}$ as a bound number,
    so there is an interval $I_g$ centered around $a$
    such that $-\frac{b}{2} < g(x) < \frac{b}{2}$
    on the interval $I_g$ excluding the center $a$.
* Let $I$ be either $I_f$ or $I_g$ depending on which interval is smaller.
* By adding the inequalities, we get $-b < f(x)+g(x) < b$ on $I$ excluding the center $a$.

graybox:
    If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are small near $a$, then $f(x)+g(x)$ is also small near $a$.

This also works if you have more than two small functions.
For example, let $f_1$ and $f_2$ be functions that are small near $a$.
Then $f_1(x)+f_2(x)$ is small near $a$ according to the above result.
If we add a third function $f_3(x)$ that is also small near $a$,
we can view the result as the sum of two functions that are small near $a$:
$$
\underbrace{f_1(x)+f_2(x)}_{\text{small near $a$}}+f_3(x)
$$
Hence $f_1(x)+f_2(x)+f_3(x)$ is small near $a$.
If we add a fourth function $f_4(x)$,
we again have the sum of two small functions.
We can continue like this as much as needed.

graybox:
    If $f_1(x),f_2(x),\dots,f_n(x)$ are small near $a$,
    then $f_1(x)+f_2(x)+\dots+f_n(x)$ is also small near $a$.


## Difference of small functions

If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are small near some number $a$,
then $f(x)-g(x)$ is also small near $a$.
That's because it can be written as
$$
f(x)-g(x) = f(x) + (-1)g(x).
$$
Here $(-1)g(x)$ is a small function multiplied by the constant $-1$, and hence small,
so we have a sum of two small functions.

graybox:
    If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are small near $a$, then $f(x)-g(x)$ is also small near $a$.


## Product of small functions

Suppose that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are small near 3.
We show that their product $f(x)g(x)$ is also small near 3.

The idea is that multiplying by a number less than 1 makes things even smaller.
For example, $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 = 3$.
Thus we can ensure that $|f(x)| < 1$ and $|g(x)| < b$,
where $b$ is whatever bound we want.
Then $|f(x)g(x)| < b$, because we can write it as
$$
|f(x)g(x)| = |f(x)| \cdot |g(x)|.
$$
Here $g(x)$ is already smaller than $b$,
and multiplying by $|f(x)|$ makes this value even smaller.

Specifically, here's how it goes:

* Let $b$ be any positive bound number.
* Because $f(x)$ is a small function,
    there is an interval $I_f$ centered around $3$
    such that $|f(x)| < 1$ on the interval $I_f$ excluding the center $3$.
* Because $g(x)$ is a small function,
    there is an interval $I_g$ centered around $3$
    such that $|g(x)| < b$ on the interval $I_g$ excluding the center $3$.
* Let $I$ be either $I_f$ or $I_g$ depending on which interval is smaller.
    We have both $|f(x)| < 1$ and $|g(x)| < b$ on $I$ excluding the center $3$.
* We now get $|f(x)g(x)| < b$ on $I$ excluding the center $3$.

graybox:
    If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are small near $a$, then $f(x)g(x)$ is also small near $a$.
