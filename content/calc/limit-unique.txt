# Uniqueness of Limit

redbox:
    Make sure that you know our [definition of limit](limit-def.html).
    In particular, make sure you know the precise meanings of "close enough to" and "$\approx$".

Can we have $\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 5$ and $\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 8$ for the same function $f$?

If you think of the notation such that $\lim_{x \to 2} f(x)$ by itself is a thing,
then this is obviously not possible;
there's no way how something could be equal to $5$ and $8$ at the same time.
However, that's not how we have defined the limit.
The definition doesn't say anything about what $\lim_{x \to 2} f(x)$ by itself is;
it only tells what setting that equal to something means,
such as $\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 5$.

Suppose $\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 5$ and $\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 8$ for the same function $f$.
Then, for any tolerance $t_1 > 0$, we have $f(x) \approx 5$ with tolerance $t_1$
when $x$ is close enough to $a$.
Also, for any tolerance $t_2 > 0$, we have $f(x) \approx 8$ with tolerance $t_2$
when $x$ is close enough to $a$.

For example, if we choose the tolerances $t_1=t_2=0.1$,
we see that $4.9 < f(x) < 5.1$ and $7.9 < f(x) < 8.1$ whenever $x$ is close enough to $a$.
This is not possible: no number can be less than $5.1$ and greater than $7.9$.
This means that a limit cannot simultaneously be $5$ and $8$.

The same applies for any two different numbers instead of $5$ and $8$
as long as we pick a reasonable tolerance.

    A limit can't be equal to two different numbers.

Also, the limit can't be equal to **more** than two different numbers, because
if a limit was equal to more than two different numbers, then we could pick two of those numbers;
the limit would be equal to them, and that's impossible by the above result.

graybox:
    A limit can be equal to at most one number.

An important consequence of this result is that
if there is some number that the limit equals to
(in other words, if the limit exists, unlike in [this example](limit-intro.html#surprising-example),
then we can write things like
$$
\left( \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \right)^2 + 7.
$$
This is a shorthand for letting $L$ be the only number for which $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$,
and then writing $L^2+7$.
We can think of $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ as a number,
because we know that it can't be equal to multiple different numbers,
which prevented us from doing that in the past.
