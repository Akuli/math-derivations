# Multiplying Complex Numbers

We already know [what multiplying a real number and a complex number does](intro.html),
$c(a+bi) = (ca)+(cb)i$ for all real numbers $c$ and complex numbers $a+bi$.
Now our goal is to define a multiplication for all complex numbers.
It will be an operation that takes in two complex numbers, $z$ and $w$,
and outputs another complex number, denoted $zw$.
We want it to have at least these properties,
for all real numbers $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$ and complex numbers $v,w,z \in \mathbb{C}$:

* Compatibility with the multiplication defined previously:
  $(c + 0i)(a + bi)$ as a complex number multiplication must produce $(ca) + (cb)i$
* Multiplying $i$ with itself behaves as expected: $i^2 = -1$
* Order doesn't matter: $zw=wz$
* Parentheses don't matter: $z(vw)=(zv)w$
  (when this rule applies, we can write $zvw$ without any parentheses,
  and it doesn't matter whether it means $(zv)w$ or $z(vw)$)
* Distributing: $z(v+w)=zv+zw$

On the rest of this page, I will call this the **wish list**.
Using the wish list, we can multiply any two complex numbers $a + bi$ and $x + yi$:
$$
\begin{align}
(a + bi)(x + yi)
&= (a + bi)x + (a + bi)(yi) \\
&= ax + (bi)x + (a + bi)(yi) \\
&= ax + (bi)x + (yi)(a + bi) \\
&= ax + (bi)x + (yi)a + (yi)(bi) \\
&= ax + bxi + ayi + byi^2 \\
&= ax + bxi + ayi + by(-1) \\
&= ax + bxi + ayi + (-by) \\
&= (ax - by) + (bx + ay)i
\end{align}
$$
I don't recommend memorizing the resulting formula.
To calculate a complex number multiplication like $(2+3i)(4-5i)$,
just expand it as you would usually do and apply $i^2 = -1$;
the wish list essentially says that it's how complex number multiplication works.

graybox:
    Any complex number multiplication can be calculated using only the wish list.

Note that the complex number multiplication is
neither [dot product](../vectors/dot-projection.html) nor cross product (TODO);
it's something else.
To see this, note that
[the vector corresponding to](intro.html#borrowing-operations-from-vectors) $i$
is $\J$. Its dot product with itself is
$$
\J \cdot \J = (0\I + 1\J) \cdot (0\I + 1\J) = 0^2 + 1^2 = 1,
$$
and its cross product with itself, when $i$ is thought of as the vector $0\I+1\J+0\K$, is
$$
\begin{vmatrix}
\I & \J & \K \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
= \I(0-0) - \J(0-0) + \K(0-0) = \vec 0.
$$
Neither of these is $-1$, and we required $i^2 = -1$.

The wish list is good for calculating complex number multiplications,
but currently we don't have any way to visualize the multiplication like
we can visualize [complex number addition](intro.html#borrowing-operations-from-vectors).
Let's fix that.


## Observations

With the wish list, we get
$$
(2i)(2 + 3i) = (2i)2 + (2i)(3i) = 4i + 6i^2 = 4i - 6 = -6 + 4i.
$$
Here are the vectors corresponding to $2+3i$ and $-6+4i$:

asymptote:
    unitsize(1.2cm);
    axises(-6,3,-1,4);
    draw((0,0)--(2,3), L="$2+3i$", arrow=Arrow(5mm), p=deepred);
    draw((0,0)--(-6,4), L="$(2i)(2+3i)$", arrow=Arrow(5mm), p=deepgreen, align=SW);
    draw(rarc((0,0), 1, atan(3/2), atan(3/2)+pi/2), p=blue);

Let's make these observations (using [angles and lengths](angle-and-len.html)):

* The blue angle in the picture looks like 90 degrees, and it actually is 90 degrees.
  To verify this, you can [calculate the dot product](../vectors/iwi-jwj.html) of
  the vectors corresponding to $2+3i$ and $-6+4i$.
  You should get $0$, which means that the vectors are perpendicular.
* The length of $(2i)(2+3i)$ is two times the length of $2+3i$.

Note that the angle of $2i$ is 90 degrees and the length of $2i$ is $2$.
What seems to be happening is that when calculating a complex number multiplication,
the angles get added and the lengths get multiplied.

Let's do another example. We multiply $1+i$ with itself.

asymptote:
    unitsize(3cm);
    axises(-1,2,-1,2);
    draw((0,0)--(1,1), L=rotate(45)*"$1+i$", arrow=Arrow(5mm), align=NW, p=deepred);
    draw((1,0)--(1,1), p=gray+smalldashes);
    draw(shift(1,0)*scale(0.2)*rotate(90)*((1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)));

The angle of this complex number is 45 degrees, and its length is
$$
\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}.
$$
To multiply $1+i$ with itself, we can use $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$,
because the derivation of that rule (TODO) can be done using only the wish list properties,
and we get
$$
(1+i)^2
= 1^2 + 2i + i^2
= 1+2i-1 = 2i,
$$
which is a complex number with length $2=\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}$ and angle $90^\circ = 45^\circ+45^\circ$ as expected.

asymptote:
    unitsize(3cm);
    axises(-1,2,-1,3);
    draw((0,0)--(0,2), L="$2i$", arrow=Arrow(5mm), p=deepgreen);
    draw((0,0)--(1,1), L=rotate(45)*"$1+i$", arrow=Arrow(5mm), align=NW, p=deepred);
    draw((1,0)--(1,1), p=gray+smalldashes);
    draw(shift(1,0)*scale(0.2)*rotate(90)*((1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)));


## Why do angles get added and lengths get multiplied?

Let's define an operation that takes in two complex numbers $z$ and $w$,
and results in another complex number that we shall denote with $z \star w$.
(I don't think anyone else uses this notation, and I won't use it after this derivation.)
We define the $\star$ operation to do what the multiplication $zw$ seems to do:
$z \star w$ is a complex number such that
$$
\text{length of $(z \star w)$} = (\text{length of $z$})(\text{length of $w$})
$$
and
$$
\text{angle of $(z \star w)$} = (\text{angle of $z$}) + (\text{angle of $w$}).
$$
The angle of $0$ is undefined, but that doesn't matter;
if $z=0$ or $w=0$, then the length of $z \star w$ will be zero anyway,
and so $z \star w = 0$ as well, regardless of the angle.

This operation satisfies all properties of the wish list;
that is, for all $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$ and $v,w,z \in \mathbb{C}$:

<ul><li>
To show that we have $c \star(a+bi) = (ca)+(cb)i$,
we ensure that both sides have the same length and angle.
The length of $(ca)+(cb)i$ is the length of $a+bi$ multiplied by the absolute value $\abs{c}$,
just like with vectors,
and because $\abs{c}$ is the length of $c$ when $c$ is viewed as a complex number,
that's also the length of $c \star (a+bi)$.
Let's check that the angles match too:
<ul><br /><li>
If $c$ is positive, then the angle of $(ca)+(cb)i$ is the angle of $a+bi$,
because the vector gets "stretched" to be $c$ times longer, without changing the angle.

asymptote:
    unitsize(1cm);
    axises(-1,4,-1,7);
    draw((0.1,0)--(1.1,2), L=Label("$a+bi$"), p=deepred, arrow=Arrow(5mm));
    draw((0,0)--(3,6), L=Label("$(ca)+(cb)i$"), p=deepgreen, arrow=Arrow(5mm));

In this case, the angle of $c \star (a+bi)$ is
$$
(\text{angle of $a+bi$}) + \underbrace{(\text{angle of $c$})}_0,
$$
so that too is just the angle of $a+bi$.
</li><li>
If $c$ is negative, then $a+bi$ and $(ca)+(cb)i$ are on the opposite sides of $0$:

asymptote:
    unitsize(1cm);
    axises(-2,2,-4,4);
    draw((0,0)--(1,2), L=Label("$a+bi$"), p=deepred, arrow=Arrow(5mm));
    draw((0,0)--(-2,-4), L=Label("$(ca)+(cb)i$"), p=deepgreen, arrow=Arrow(5mm));

Because the angle of $c$ is 180 degrees,
the angle of $c \star (a+bi)$ is 180 degrees more than the angle of $a+bi$,
so that too is on the opposite side of $0$.
Again, it has the same angle as $(ca)+(cb)i$.
</li><li>
If $c=0$ (or $a+bi=0$), then $c \star(a+bi)$ and $(ca)+(cb)i$ are both zero.
</li><br /></ul>
</li><li>
Because the length of $i$ is 1 and the angle is 90 degrees,
the length of $i \star i$ is also 1 and its angle is 180 degrees.
So, we have $i \star i = -1$.
</li><li>
Order and parentheses don't matter when adding or multiplying real numbers.
Because calculations like $z\star v$ or $(z \star v) \star w$
add the angles and multiply the lengths of all complex numbers involved,
order and parentheses don't matter with $\star$ either.
</li><li>
Let's check that the distributing $z(v+w)=zv+zw$ works.
Consider a rotation around $0$ by the angle of $z$.
This can be described like this: $\rotate(w)$ is a complex number
just like $w$ but with the angle of $z$ added to its angle.
Now $z \star w$ is just like $\rotate(w)$, but with the length multiplied by the length of $z$.
In other words,
$$
z \star w = \abs{z} \rotate(w).
$$
The following picture shows that $\rotate(v+w)=\rotate(v)+\rotate(w)$,
because the entire triangle created by $v$, $w$ and $v+w$ gets rotated:

asymptote:
    unitsize(2cm);
    axises(-1,4,-1,3.5);

    pair v = (3,2);
    pair w = (-0.2,1);

    void draw_stuff(string prefix, string suffix, transform R, real p, real q) {
        draw((0,0)--(R*v), L=Label(prefix+"v"+suffix, position=Relative(p)), arrow=Arrow(5mm), p=deepgreen);
        draw((R*v)--(R*(v+w)), L=prefix+"w"+suffix, arrow=Arrow(5mm), p=deepred);
        draw((0,0)--(R*(v+w)), L=Label(prefix+"v+w"+suffix, position=Relative(q)), arrow=Arrow(5mm), p=blue, align=R*NW);
    }

    draw_stuff("$", "$", rotate(0), 0.5, 0.8);
    draw_stuff("rotate$(", ")$", rotate(100), 0.8, 0.5);

By multiplying both sides of $\rotate(v+w)=\rotate(v)+\rotate(w)$ with $\abs{z}$
and distributing it like we usually do when multiplying vectors and numbers, we get
$$
\underbrace{\abs{z}\rotate(v+w)}_{z \star (v+w)}
= \underbrace{\abs{z}\rotate(v)}_{z \star v}
+ \underbrace{\abs{z}\rotate(w)}_{z \star w}.
$$
The angle of $z$ is undefined when $z = 0$,
but $z\star(v+w)=(z \star v) + (z \star w)$ is also true in that case;
then it just says that $0 = 0+0$.
</li></ul>

Because any complex number multiplication $zw$ can be calculated using only the wish list properties
and the $\star$ operation satisfies the wish list properties,
$z \star w$ must be $zw$.
So, our $\star$ operation really is the complex number multiplication.

graybox:
    When multiplying complex numbers, we can add the angles and multiply the lengths:
    \begin{align*}
    \text{angle of $zw$} &= (\text{angle of $z$})+(\text{angle of $w$}) \\
    \abs{zw} &= \abs{z}\,\abs{w}
    \end{align*}


## De Moivre's formula

Let $z$ be a complex number with angle $\theta$ and length 1.
It is on the unit circle of radius $1$ centered at $0$, at the angle $\theta$.

asymptote:
    unitsize(5cm);
    axises(-1.2, 1.4, -1.2, 1.4);
    real theta = 2;
    draw(unitcircle, p=blue);
    draw((0,0)--cis(theta), L="$z$", arrow=Arrow(5mm), p=deepred, align=SW);
    draw(rarc((0,0), 0.3, 0, theta), L="$\theta$", p=deepgreen);

With trig, we see that $z = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)$.

We calculate $z^n$ for any positive integer $n$.
Because the length of $z$ is 1,
the length of $z^2$ is also $1$, and so is the length of $z^3 = z^2 \cdot z$ and so on.
So, the length of $z^n$ is $1$.
The angle of $z^2$ is $\theta+\theta=2\theta$,
the angle of $z^3$ is $2\theta+\theta=3\theta$, and so on,
so the angle of $z^n$ is $n\theta$.
Because $z^n$ has length $1$, it's on the unit circle,
just like $z$ but with angle $n\theta$ instead of $\theta$, and we get
$$
z^n = \cos(n\theta) +i\sin(n\theta).
$$

graybox:
    For any angle $\theta$ and positive integer $n$, we have
    $$
    (\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))^n = \cos(n\theta)+i\sin(n\theta).
    $$
    This is known as De Moivre's formula.


## Example: $\sin(2\theta)$ and $\cos(2\theta)$

By plugging in $n=2$ to De Moivre's formula and using $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$, we get
$$
\begin{align}
\cos(2\theta) + i\sin(2\theta)
&= (\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta))^2 \\
&= (\cos(\theta))^2 + 2\cos(\theta)i\sin(\theta) + (i\sin(\theta))^2 \\
&= \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta) + 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)i,
\end{align}
$$
where the minus in front of $\sin^2(\theta)$ came from $i^2=-1$.
By comparing the real parts and imaginary parts
($x$ and $y$ coordinates of vectors corresponding to the complex numbers)
on both sides, we get the following result.

graybox:
    For any angle $\theta$, we have
    $$
    \begin{align}
    \cos(2\theta) &= \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta), \\
    \sin(2\theta) &= 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta).
    \end{align}
    $$

A similar derivation can be used to write $\sin(n\theta)$ and $\cos(n\theta)$
using only $\sin(\theta)$ and $\cos(\theta)$,
with any other positive integer $n$.
For doing that, one needs to expand $(a+b)^n$, and
the [binomial formula](../discrete/binom.html#binomial-formula) can be used for that.
