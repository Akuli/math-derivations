# How does Solving Inequations Work?

Recall from [solving equations](how-equations-work.html) that
we solve equations by rewriting them with $\iff$ at each step,
and if $f$ is a function that has an inverse function, then we can apply it on both sides.

For solving inequations, we do a similar thing,
but we can't just apply any function with some inverse function on both sides.
For example, the function $f(x) = -2x$ has an inverse function, but
applying it on both sides of the inequation $1 < 2$ gives $-2 < -4$, which is false.

Next we will prove that if $f$ is a [strictly increasing](incdec-funcs.html) function,
then we can apply it on both sides of an inequation with a $ < $ sign, and it will work correctly
(we will consider other kinds of inequations soon):
$$
x < y \iff f(x) < f(y)
$$

The $\Rightarrow$ direction is easy;
if $x < y$, then $f(x) < f(y)$, by the definition of strictly increasing.
We still need the $\Leftarrow$ direction: we need to show that if $f(x) < f(y)$, then $x < y$.
We have proved that [the inverse of a strictly increasing function
is also strictly increasing](incdec-funcs.html#is-the-inverse-strictly-increasing-decreasing), so
if $f(x) < f(y)$, then we have
$$
x = f^{-1}(f(x)) < f^{-1}(f(y)) = y,
$$
where in the middle, we used the definition of strictly increasingness for the function $f^{-1}$,
and the first and last equality came from definition of inverse function.
This shows that $x < y$, which is what we wanted.

    A strictly increasing function can be applied on both sides when solving an inequation with $ < $ sign.

Of course, this works similarly for inequations with $ > $ instead of $ < $.
It even works for inequations having $\le$ or $\ge$, because
$$
\begin{align}
x \ge y
&\iff \text{we do NOT have $\underbrace{x < y}_{\substack{\text{equivalent} \\ \text{with:} \\ f(x) < f(y)}}$} \\
&\iff \text{we do NOT have $f(x) < f(y)$} \\
&\iff f(x) \ge f(y).
\end{align}
$$
We assumed that the function $f$ is strictly increasing, so
by the previous result, $x < y$ and $f(x) < f(y)$ are equivalent.
It means that they have the same truth value (either both true, or both false),
so we can replace one with the other.

graybox:
    A strictly increasing function can be applied on both sides when solving any inequation.

Again, a similar calculation for strictly decreasing functions shows that we get similar results,
but this time, the sign must be flipped;
this comes from the definition of strictly decreasing,
because there we had different signs in $a < b$ and $f(a) > f(b)$.

graybox:
    A strictly decreasing function can be applied on both sides when solving any inequation,
    and the sign must be flipped.

As special cases of these results, we let $a$ be any number, and we consider the functions
$f(x) = x+a$, $g(x) = x-a$, $h(x) = ax$ and $i(x) = \frac{x}{a}$:

<ul><li>
    The functions $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing (graph is a line with slope $1$, which is positive).
    This means that they can be applied on both sides of any inequation, without flipping sign.
    Applying $f$ on both sides of an inequation is adding $a$ on both sides, and
    applying $g$ on both sides of an inequation is subtracting $a$ on both sides.
</li><li>
    The graph of $h$ is a line with slope $a$, and
    <ul><li>
        if $a > 0$, then $h$ is strictly increasing;
    </li><li>
        if $a < 0$, then $h$ is strictly decreasing;
    </li><li>
        if $a = 0$, then $h$ is neither strictly nor strictly decreasing.
    </li></ul>
    Applying $h$ on both sides of an inequation is multiplying both sides by $a$.
</li><li>
    If $a = 0$, then $i(x)$ is undefined for any $x$. Suppose that $a$ is nonzero.
    Now $i$ is the inverse function of $h$,
    so it is strictly increasing whenever $h$ is strictly increasing,
    and strictly decreasing whenever $h$ is strictly decreasing.
    Applying $i$ on both sides of an inequation is dividing both sides $a$.
</li></ul>

Combining all this with the previous results, we get the following.

graybox:
    When solving an inequation, we can
    <ul><li>
        add or subtract a number on both sides without flipping sign,
    </li><li>
        multiply or divide by a positive number on both sides without flipping sign, and
    </li><li>
        multiply or divide by a negative number on both sides and flip the sign.
    </li></ul>
