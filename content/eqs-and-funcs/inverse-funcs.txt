# Inverse Functions

insert-function-warning-here

The inverse function of a function $f$ is a function that takes in a value of $f$ as an argument,
and it answers the question "which input did $f$ take when it gave this value".
In other words,
$$
(\text{inverse function of $f$})(f(x)) = x
$$
for all numbers $x$ for which $f(x)$ is defined.

For example, let $f(x) = 2x$ and $g(x) = \frac{x}{2}$.
Now $g$ is the inverse function of $f$, because
$$
g(f(x)) = \frac{2x}{2} = x
$$
for all numbers $x$.

The inverse function of $f$ is often denoted with $f^{-1}$.
Be careful to not confuse this notation with powers.
For example, $3^{-1} = \frac{1}{3}$ is a number, but
if $f(x) = 2x$, then $f^{-1}$ is a function, given by $f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x}{2}$.


## Issues

One problem with inverse functions is that they might not be defined for all numbers,
even if the original function is defined for all numbers.
For example, let $f(x) = 2^x$ and $g(x) = \log_2(x)$.
Now $f(x)$ is defined for all numbers $x$.
From logarithms, we know that $g(f(x)) = \log_2(2^x) = x$, so $g$ is the inverse function of $f$.
However, $g(-1)$ is undefined, because $f(x)=2^x$ is always positive;
there is no number $x$ for which $f(x) = -1$, which is what $g(-1)$ means.

Another problem is that not all functions have an inverse function.
For example, let $f(x) = x^2$.
Now we have $f(2) = 4 = f(-2)$, so what should $(\text{inverse function of $f$})(4)$ do?
Should that evaluate to $2$ or $-2$?
We don't want to just pick one choice randomly, so instead we say that it's undefined.
However, there is an inverse function if this problem doesn't occur; that is,
if $f(a) \ne f(b)$ for all numbers $a,b$ satisfying $a \ne b$.
