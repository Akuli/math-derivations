# Defining determinants

A determinant is a function that takes in a square matrix and outputs a number.
For $2 \times 2$ matrices, it represents the area of a parallelogram with the vectors as sides,
possibly with a minus sign front.

TODO: define in detail, add animation, explain

The determinant of a $3 \times 3$ matrix is the volume of a **parallelepiped**,
possibly with a minus sign in front.
A parallelepiped is similar to a parallelogram in 2D, and looks like this:

A 3D determinant is positive when (TODO: finish this definition)

Examples:
<ul><li>
    If a $2 \times 2$ determinant contains the same row twice,
    it is zero, because the parallelogram is flat, and it has zero area.
    This also happens if one row is a multiple of the other.
    The same works with $3 \times 3$ determinants.
</li><li>
    The determinant of the $2 \times 2$ identity matrix is
    $$
    \det\begin{bmatrix}\red1&\red0\\\blue0&\blue1\end{bmatrix}=1,
    $$
    because the first row $\red{(1,0)}$ and the second row $\blue{(0,1)}$
    form the sides of a square with side length $1$ and area $1^2 = 1$,
    and an arrow from $\red{(1,0)}$ to $\blue{(1,0)}$ along the square goes counter-clockwise.
    (TODO: draw picture)
</li><li>
    $\det(I)=1$ works with $3 \times 3$ determinants too.
    The unit vectors are the sides of a cube, with side length 1 and therefore volume $1^3 = 1$.
    (TODO: sign of determinant)
    (TODO: draw picture)
</li><li>
    Let's swap the rows of the $2 \times 2$ identity matrix.
    The rows are still the sides of a square, so the area remains the same,
    but the arrow from top row to bottom row now goes in a different direction.

    TODO: draw picture

    Therefore
    $$
    \det\begin{bmatrix}\blue0&\blue1\\\red1&\red0\end{bmatrix} = -1.
    $$
    This happens when swapping the rows of any $2 \times 2$ determinant.
    It also works when swapping any two rows of a $3 \times 3$ determinant:
    the volume obviously doesn't change,
    and the sign flips in all cases, because of how it is defined.
    Let me know if you want to see more details about this.

## Defining $n \times n$ determinants

As explained at the end of [the introduction page](rotating-intro.html),
it is often useful to use linear algebra with higher dimensions than 2 or 3.
To do that, we will next define $n \times n$ determinants in a way that works regardless of size.

graybox:
    An $n$-dimensional determinant, denoted with $\det$, is any function that
    takes $n \times n$ matrices as inputs and outputs numbers,
    and satisfies these properties:
    <ul><li>
        $\det(I) = 1$.
    </li><li>
        Swapping any two rows of a matrix changes the sign of the determinant,
        but does not affect the absolute value.
    </li><li>
        The determinant is linear as a function of each row.
        In other words, if $f$ is a function that takes in a vector $\vec v$
        and outputs a determinant with $\vec v$ as one of the rows,
        then $f(\vec v +\vec w) = f(\vec v) + f(\vec w)$.
    </li></ul>

Based on the derivations on this page,
what we called "$2 \times 2$ determinant" and "$3 \times 3$ determinant"
are determinants, according to this definition.
