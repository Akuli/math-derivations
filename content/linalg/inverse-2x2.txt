# 2Ã—2 inverse matrix formula

comment:
    math in title doesn't work very well

[Previously](inverse-finding.html#finding-the-inverse-with-elementary-row-operations) we calculated
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
= \begin{bmatrix}
-2 & 1 \\ \frac{3}{2} & -\frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
There's a pattern in this inverse matrix.
To see it, let's rewrite it as [a multiplication with a matrix and a number](matrix-num.html):
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1&2 \\ 3&4 \end{bmatrix}^{-1}
= \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} -4 & 2 \\ 3 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
$$
If we ignore the $\frac{1}{2}$ for now,
we see that the resulting matrix contains the same numbers as the original matrix.
Specifically, it seems like the inverse of a $2 \times 2$ matrix
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\ c & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$
is
$$
A^{-1} = (\text{magic number}) \begin{bmatrix} -d & b \\ c & -a \end{bmatrix},
$$
where the top left and bottom right corner are swapped,
and they also have minuses in front.

With the correct inverse matrix, we have $A A^{-1} = I$.
Let's see what we get if we instead use our guessed inverse matrix,
ignoring the magic number in front for now:
$$
\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix} \red a & \red b \\ \blue c & \blue d \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \magenta{-d} & \green b \\ \magenta c & \green{-a} \end{bmatrix}
&= \begin{bmatrix}
\red{(a,b)} \cdot \magenta{(-d,c)} & \red{(a,b)} \cdot \green{(b,-a)} \\
\blue{(c,d)} \cdot \magenta{(-d,c)} & \blue{(c,d)} \cdot \green{(b,-a)}
\end{bmatrix} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix}
-ad+bc & 0 \\ 0 & bc-ad
\end{bmatrix}
= (-ad+bc)I
\end{align}
$$
Dividing both sides by $-ad+bc$ gives
$$
\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{-ad+bc}
\begin{bmatrix} -d & b \\ c & -a \end{bmatrix}
= I.
$$
We have derived a formula for the inverse of a $2 \times 2$ matrix:

    $$
    \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}^{-1}
    = \frac{1}{-ad+bc} \begin{bmatrix} -d & b \\ c & -a \end{bmatrix}
    $$


## Dividing by zero

Because we had to divide by $-ad+bc$, we need to consider when it is zero.
If the original matrix $A$ is not invertible,
[its columns are linearly independent](matrix-inverse.html#when-does-an-inverse-matrix-exist),
so one of them is a linear combination of the other.
If $(a,c) = 5(b,d)$, for example, then
$$
-ad+bc = -(5b)d + b(5d) = 0.
$$
The same works with any other number of $5$, and also if $(b,d)$ is a multiple of $(a,c)$.

graybox:
    If a $2 \times 2$ matrix is not invertible,
    then the inverse matrix formula divides by zero.

Next we figure out whether it can divide by zero even if the matrix $A$ is invertible.
If $-ad+bc=0$, then $(-ad+bc)I$ is the zero matrix
$$
O = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0& 0 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
The above equations now give
$$
A
\begin{bmatrix} -d & b \\ c & -a \end{bmatrix} = O.
$$
Unlike you might expect, this can happen even if $A$ is not the zero matrix;
try $a=b=c=0$ and $d=1$ for example.
If $A$ was invertible,
with some inverse matrix $A^{-1}$ that the formula can't give us as it divides by zero,
we would get
$$
A^{-1} A \begin{bmatrix} -d & b \\ c & -a \end{bmatrix} = A^{-1}O = O.
$$
Because $A^{-1}A$ is the identity matrix, multiplying by it does nothing, and we get
$$
\begin{bmatrix} -d & b \\ c & -a \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0&0 \\ 0&0 \end{bmatrix},
$$
and now we get $a=b=c=d=0$, which is impossible,
because $A$ was supposed to be invertible but the zero matrix isn't.
This shows that we can't have $-ad+bc=0$ with an invertible matrix.

graybox:
    If a $2 \times 2$ matrix is invertible,
    then the inverse matrix formula does not divide by zero
    and produces the correct result.
