# Cross product

The cross product is an operation that takes in two 3D vectors,
similarly to [dot product](dot-projection.html),
but the result is a vector (the result of a dot product is a number).
We define it like this: the cross product $\vec v \times \vec w$ is a vector whose

<ul><li>
    direction is perpendicular to both $\vec v$ and $\vec w$,
    with right-hand rule used to choose one of the two perpendicular directions (see below)
</li><li>
    length is the area of a rectangle with $\vec v$ and $\vec w$ as sides.
</li></ul>

The animation below shows how this definition works.

<div id="cross-demo-container" style="position:relative">
    <!--
    no idea why nested divs are needed for transform:translate(...) to work
    hard-coded styles in here because it seems convenient
    -->

    <div
        style="position:absolute;color:white;z-index:123;transform:translate(-50%,-100%)"
        id="fixed-vector-text"
    >
        <div>$\vec v$</div>
    </div>

    <div
        style="position:absolute;color:white;z-index:123;transform:translate(-50%,-100%)"
        id="moving-vector-text"
    >
        <div>$\vec w$</div>
    </div>

    <div
        style="position:absolute;color:white;z-index:123;transform:translate(10%,-50%)"
        id="cross-product-text"
    >
        <div>$\vec v \times \vec w$</div>
    </div>

    <div
        style="position:absolute;color:white;z-index:123;transform:translate(-50%,-50%)"
        id="parallelogram-text"
    >
        <div>$|\vec v \times \vec w|$</div>
    </div>

</div>

If the area of the rectangle with $\vec v$ and $\vec w$ as sides is nonzero,
there are two possible directions that are perpendicular to both $\vec v$ and $\vec w$;
these are the directions that are perpendicular to the plane that contains $\vec v$ and $\vec w$.
We use the right-hand rule to define the direction of $\vec v \times \vec w$:
if your index finger points along $\vec v$ and middle finger along $\vec w$,
then your thumb indicates the direction of $\vec v \times \vec w$.

You may need to rotate your hand to find the direction of a cross product.
For example, when $\vec w$ passes $\vec v$ in the above animation,
you need to flip your hand around to keep your middle finger
pointing in the direction of $\vec w$.
