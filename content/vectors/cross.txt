# Cross product

The cross product is an operation that takes in two 3D vectors,
similarly to [dot product](dot-projection.html),
but the result is a vector (the result of a dot product is a number).
We define it like this: the cross product $\vec a \times \vec b$ is a vector whose

<ul><li>
    direction is perpendicular to both $\vec a$ and $\vec b$,
    with right-hand rule used to choose one of the two perpendicular directions (see below)
</li><li>
    length is the area of a rectangle with $\vec a$ and $\vec b$ as sides.
</li></ul>

The animation below shows how this definition works.

<div id="cross-demo-container" style="position:relative">
    <div style="position:absolute;color:white;z-index:123" id="fixed-vector-text">$\vec a$</div>
    <div style="position:absolute;color:white;z-index:123" id="moving-vector-text">$\vec b$</div>
    <div style="position:absolute;color:white;z-index:123" id="cross-product-text">$\vec a \times \vec b$</div>
    <div style="position:absolute;color:white;z-index:123" id="parallelogram-text">$|\vec a \times \vec b|$</div>
</div>

If the area of the rectangle with $\vec a$ and $\vec b$ as sides is nonzero,
there are two possible directions that are perpendicular to both $\vec a$ and $\vec b$;
these are the directions that are perpendicular to the plane that contains $\vec a$ and $\vec b$.
We use the right-hand rule to define the direction of a cross product:
if your index finger points along $\vec a$ and middle finger along $\vec b$,
then your thumb indicates the direction of $\vec a$ and $\vec b$.

You may need to rotate your hand to find the direction of a cross product.
For example, when $\vec b$ passes $\vec a$ in the above animation,
you need to flip your hand around to keep your middle finger
pointing in the direction of $\vec b$.
