<h1 id="increasing-and-decreasing-functions">Increasing and Decreasing Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#increasing-and-decreasing-functions" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h1><div class="box redbox"><p>On this page, the word "function" means a function that takes in a real number as its only argument,
and evaluates to another real number.
Some real numbers might not be valid inputs of the function; for example,
square root is a function that accepts only nonnegative inputs.
</p>

</div><h2 id="definition-of-strictly-increasing">Definition of Strictly Increasing<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-strictly-increasing" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>A function $f$ is called <b>strictly increasing</b>, if for all numbers $a$ and $b$ satisfying $a < b$,
we have $f(a) < f(b)$.
If the function $f$ is not defined for all numbers,
then we only require that this happens for all numbers $a,b$ for which $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are defined.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>
    Let $f(x) = x+1$.
    This <b>is</b> a strictly increasing function,
    because for all numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a < b$, we have $a+1 < b+1$.
    Because $f(a)=a+1$ and $f(b)=b+1$, this means that we have $f(a) < f(b)$.
</li>
<li>
    Let $f(x) = 3$.
    This is <b>not</b> a strictly increasing function, because
    that would mean that for all numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a < b$, we have $3 < 3$,
    which is not true.
</li>
<li>
    Let $f(x) = x^2$.
    This is <b>not</b> a strictly increasing function, because $-2 < -1$ but $f(-2) > f(-1)$.
</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Next, let's talk about what this looks like in a graph.
Let $f$ be a function, and consider the graph $y=f(x)$.
Let $a$ and $b$ be numbers for which $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are defined and $a < b$.
The condition $a < b$ means that if $a$ and $b$ are drawn on the $x$ axis,
then $a$ is on the left side of $b$.</p>

<p><img width="367" height="366" class="asymptote" src="../asymptote/333c550d8170480d2b36454e0cf3435a.svg" /></p><p>Now the condition $f(a) < f(b)$ means that the graph is higher at $b$ than it is at $a$;
in other words, the value of the function increases if you go from $a$ to $b$.
When defining what strictly increasing means,
we require that this happens for <b>all</b> $a$ and $b$ with $a < b$.
</p>

<h2 id="definition-of-strictly-decreasing">Definition of Strictly Decreasing<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-strictly-decreasing" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>A function $f$ is called <b>strictly decreasing</b>, if for all numbers $a$ and $b$ satisfying $a < b$,
we have $f(a) > f(b)$.
If the function $f$ is not defined for all numbers,
then we only require that this happens for all numbers $a,b$ for which $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are defined.</p>

<p>The definition is otherwise the same as for strictly increasing, but
the sign between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ is $ > $ instead of $ < $.
This means that in the graph of $f$, going from $a$ to $b$ will give a decrease in the $y$ value.</p>

<p><img width="367" height="366" class="asymptote" src="../asymptote/dd93f79a7629adae71261ace36a276fc.svg" /></p><h2 id="the-function-f-x-sx-h">The Function $f(x)=sx+h$<a class="headerlink" href="#the-function-f-x-sx-h" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>From <a href="../analytic-plane-geometry/line-eq-slope.html#meaning-of-s-and-h">line equation with slope</a>,
we know that if $s$ and $h$ are any numbers,
then $y=sx+h$ is the equation of some non-vertical line, with the vector $\I+s\J$ going along the line.
The vector $\I$ is horizontal, of course, but the effect of the ${}+s\J$ part depends on the value of $s$:</p>

<p><ul><li>
    If $s$ is positive, then $s\J$ goes up.
</li><li>
    If $s$ is zero, then $s\J$ is the zero vector.
</li><li>
    If $s$ is negative, then $s\J$ goes down.
</li></ul></p>

<p>The following pictures show what this looks like:</p>

<p><img width="249" height="266" class="asymptote" src="../asymptote/8da4c5da164d8728ef5ca06d4a98d0c1.svg" /></p><p><img width="220" height="72" class="asymptote" src="../asymptote/3e6d7960d05965dadff717024aed54e0.svg" /></p><p><img width="221" height="290" class="asymptote" src="../asymptote/cf851d715559717536ecfcb07795bc17.svg" /></p><p>The above lines are graphs of the function $f(x)=sx+h$.
We get the following result by comparing these graphs with the graphs I drew when
explaining the definitions of strictly increasing and strictly decreasing.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>The function $f(x) = sx+h$ is strictly increasing if and only if $s > 0$,
and strictly decreasing if and only if $s < 0$.
</p>

</div><p>If $s=0$, we get the function $f(x)=h$, which is neither strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing.
</p>

<h2 id="definition-of-inverse-function">Definition of Inverse Function<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-inverse-function" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>The inverse function of $f$ is a function that takes in a value of $f$ as an argument,
and it answers the question "which input did $f$ take when it gave this value".
In other words,
$$
(\text{inverse function of $f$})(f(x)) = x
$$
for all numbers $x$ for which $f(x)$ is defined.</p>

<p>For example, let $f(x) = 2x$ and $g(x) = \frac{x}{2}$.
Now $g$ is the inverse function of $f$, because
$$
g(f(x)) = \frac{2x}{2} = x
$$
for all numbers $x$.</p>

<p>One problem with inverse functions is that they might not be defined for all numbers,
even if the original function is defined for all numbers.
For example, let $f(x) = 2^x$ and $g(x) = \log_2(x)$.
Now $f(x)$ is defined for all numbers $x$.
From logarithms, we know that $g(f(x)) = \log_2(2^x) = x$, so $g$ is the inverse function of $f$.
However, $g(-1)$ is undefined, because $f(x)=2^x$ is always positive;
there is no number $x$ for which $f(x) = -1$, which is what $g(-1)$ means.</p>

<p>Another problem is that not all functions have an inverse function.
For example, let $f(x) = x^2$.
Now we have $f(2) = 4 = f(-2)$, so what should $(\text{inverse function of $f$})(4)$ do?
Should that evaluate to $2$ or $-2$?
We don't want to just pick one choice randomly, so instead we say that it's undefined.
However, there is an inverse function if this problem doesn't occur; that is,
if $f(a) \ne f(b)$ for all numbers $a,b$ satisfying $a \ne b$.</p>

<p>The inverse function of $f$ is often denoted with $f^{-1}$.
Be careful to not confuse this with powers.
For example, $3^{-1} = \frac{1}{3}$ is a number, but
if $f(x) = 2x$, then $f^{-1}$ is a function, given by $f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x}{2}$.
</p>

<h2 id="inverse-of-strictly-increasing-decreasing-function">Inverse of Strictly Increasing/Decreasing Function<a class="headerlink" href="#inverse-of-strictly-increasing-decreasing-function" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>Here are some example functions that we looked into above, or at least are very similar to what we had:</p>

<p><ul><li>
    The function $f(x)=2x$ is strictly increasing, and
    it has an inverse function given by $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x}{2}$.
</li><li>
    The function $g(x)=-2x$ is strictly decreasing, and
    it has an inverse function given by $g^{-1}(x) = \frac{x}{-2}$.
</li><li>
    The function $h(x)=x^2$ is neither strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing, and
    it does <b>not</b> have an inverse function.
</li></ul></p>

<p>In these examples, the only strictly increasing function $f$ has an inverse function.
Let's figure out whether <b>any</b> strictly increasing function $f$ has an inverse function.
The only thing that could go wrong is getting the same $f$ values for two different inputs;
that is, $a \ne b$ but $f(a)=f(b)$.
This can't happen with a strictly increasing $f$, because</p>

<p><ul><li>
    if $a < b$, then $f(a) < f(b)$;
</li><li>
    if $a > b$, then $b < a$ and so $f(b) < f(a)$.
</li></ul></p>

<p>Either way, we get $f(a) \ne f(b)$ whenever $a \ne b$.
A similar proof works for strictly decreasing functions.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>A strictly increasing or strictly decreasing function has an inverse function.
</p>

</div><p>This does not go the other way:
there are functions that have an inverse function but are
neither strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing.
TODO: example $f(x)=1/x$ with $f(0)=0$</p>

<p>The inverse of $f(x)=2x$ is $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x}{2} = \frac 1 2 x$,
which itself is also a strictly increasing function.
Next we'll prove that the inverse of any strictly increasing function is also strictly increasing.</p>

<p>Let $f$ be a strictly increasing function, and
let $a$ and $b$ be numbers such that $a < b$, $f^{-1}(a)$ is defined, and $f^{-1}(b)$ is defined.
Now we need to show that $f^{-1}(a) < f^{-1}(b)$, which will then prove that $f^{-1}$ is strictly increasing.</p>

<p>Because $f^{-1}(a)$ and $f^{-1}(b)$ are defined, we know that $a$ and $b$ must be values of $f$,
corresponding to some input numbers that have been given to $f$.
We call these input numbers $A$ and $B$, so we have $f(A)=a$ and $f(B)=b$.</p>

<p><img width="80" height="162" class="asymptote" src="../asymptote/3c43ef40f920d836b3cbb388f132d5ad.svg" /></p><p>Combining some of the things we have so far, we get
$$
f^{-1}(a) = f^{-1}(f(A)) = A,
$$
where we started by substituting $a=f(A)$,
and then we used the definition of inverse function.
Similarly $f^{-1}(b) = B$.
So, we just need to show that $A < B$ and we'll be done.</p>

<p>To show that $A < B$, we show that all other options are impossible:</p>

<p><ul><li>
    If $A=B$, then $a = f(A) = f(B) = b$.
    However, we started by assuming $a < b$, so this is impossible;
    $a$ and $b$ can't be the same number.
</li><li>
    If $A > B$, then $a = f(A) > f(B) = b$, where in the middle,
    we used the assumption that $f$ is strictly increasing.
    This is also impossible because we have $a < b$.
</li></ul></p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>The inverse function of a strictly increasing function is strictly increasing.
</p>

</div><p>Again, there's a similar proof for strictly decreasing functions.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>The inverse function of a strictly decreasing function is strictly decreasing.
</p>

</div><h2 id="equivalence-and-equations">Equivalence and Equations<a class="headerlink" href="#equivalence-and-equations" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>Let's talk about equivalence, also known as "if and only if", or $\iff$.
In general, $A \iff B$ means that if one of $A$ and $B$ is true, then the other one is also true.
Also, if one of $A$ and $B$ is false, then the other is also false;
for example, if $A$ is false, then $B$ can't be true because that would imply that $A$ is also true.</p>

<p>At a higher level, $A$ and $B$ have the same "truth value", either both true or both false.
This means that we can solve an equation like this:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align}
\text{equation we want to solve}
&\iff \text{something} \\
&\iff \text{something} \\
&\qquad \vdots \\
&\iff \text{something} \\
&\iff x = 5 \text{ or } x = 7
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>This guarantees that $x=5$ and $x=7$ are the solutions of the equation, and there are no other solutions;
the original equation is true if $x$ is $5$ or $7$, and otherwise it's false.
For this reason, we always solve equations so that we have equivalence at each step.
It is very common to teach students to do this without writing down the equivalence signs.</p>

<p>Common things that can be done to an equality so that we get equivalence:</p>

<p><ul><li>
    Adding a number on both sides: $x=y \iff x+z=y+z$.
</li><li>
    Subtracting a number on both sides.
</li><li>
    Multiplying both sides by a nonzero number: if $z \ne 0$, then $x=y \iff xz=yz$.
    We need a nonzero $z$ for this, because we also want to say that if $xz=yz$, then $x=y$;
    this doesn't work if $z=0$.
    For example, $3 \cdot 0 = 4 \cdot 0$, but $3 \ne 4$.
</li><li>
    Dividing both sides by a nonzero number: if $z \ne 0$, then $x=y \iff \frac{x}{z} = \frac{y}{z}$.
    This is actually a special case of the previous one, because
    dividing by $z$ is same as multiplying by $\frac{1}{z}$; we have
    $$
    \frac{x}{z} = \frac{1}{z} x, \quad \frac{y}{z} = \frac{1}{z} y.
    $$
</li></ul></p>

<p>Notice that squaring both sides is <b>not</b> one of the things that can be done; for example,
$-2 \ne 2$ but $(-2)^2 = 4 = 2^2$, and hence $-2 = 2$ is not equivalent with $(-2)^2 = 2^2$.
To see an example where doing this gives wrong results, consider the equation $x=x+1$,
which has no solutions because we always have $x < x+1$.
Squaring both sides gives
$$
\begin{align}
x^2 = (x+1)^2
&\iff x^2 = x^2+2x+1 \\
&\iff 0 = 2x+1 \\
&\iff x = -\frac{1}{2},
\end{align}
$$
which is not what we want for solving $x = x+1$.
</p>

<h2 id="inverse-functions-and-equations">Inverse Functions and Equations<a class="headerlink" href="#inverse-functions-and-equations" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>If $f$ is a function and $x = y$, then clearly $f(x) = f(y)$;
$x = y$ means that we can replace $x$ with $y$ whenever we see $x$.
This doesn't always go in the other direction;
we saw this earlier with $f(-2)=f(2)$ but $2 \ne 2$, with the function $f(x) = x^2$.
However, if $f$ has an inverse function and $f(x) = f(y)$, then
$f^{-1}(f(x)) = f^{-1}(f(y))$.
By the definition of inverse function, we have $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ and $f^{-1}(f(y)) = y$,
so $x = y$.</p>

<p>We have shown that if a function $f$ has an inverse function, then $x=y \iff f(x)=f(y)$.
This means that we can apply $f$ on both sides while solving an equation.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>If $f$ is a function that has an inverse function, then
$f$ can be applied on both sides while solving an equation.
</p>

</div><p>Above, we proved that any strictly increasing or strictly decreasing function has an inverse function.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>Any strictly increasing or strictly decreasing function
can be applied on both sides while solving an equation.
</p>

</div><h2 id="equivalence-and-inequalities">Equivalence and Inequalities<a class="headerlink" href="#equivalence-and-inequalities" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>For solving inequalities, we do a similar thing:
we rewrite the inequality in equivalent ways until we are left with the solution.
Let's figure out what happens to the usual rules of doing something on both sides.</p>

<p>Next we will prove that if $f$ is a strictly increasing function,
then we can apply it on both sides of an inequality with a $ < $ sign
(we will consider other kinds of equations and inequalities soon):
$$
x < y \iff f(x) < f(y)
$$</p>

<p>If $x < y$, then $f(x) < f(y)$, because $f$ is strictly increasing.
However, this is just half of equivalence; we still need to show that if $f(x) < f(y)$, then $x < y$.
Above we showed that the inverse of a strictly increasing function is also strictly increasing, so
if $f(x) < f(y)$, then we have
$$
f^{-1}(f(x)) < f^{-1}(f(y)),
$$
and by definition of inverse function, $f^{-1}(f(x))=x$ and $f^{-1}(f(y))=y$, so $x < y$.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>A strictly increasing function can be applied on both sides when solving an inequality with $ < $ sign.
</p>

</div><p>Of course, this works similarly for inequalities with $ > $ instead of $ < $.
It even works for inequalities having $\le$ or $\ge$, because
$$
\begin{align}
x \le y
&\iff \text{we do NOT have $\underbrace{x > y}_{\substack{\text{equivalent} \\ \text{with:} \\ f(x) > f(y)}}$} \\
&\iff \text{we do NOT have $f(x) > f(y)$} \\
&\iff f(x) \le f(y).
\end{align}
$$
Here we can replace $x > y$ with the equivalent $f(x) > f(y)$;
equivalence means that those two things have the same truth value (either both true, or both false),
which is all that matters.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>A strictly increasing function can be applied on both sides when solving any inequality.
</p>

</div><p>Again, a similar calculation for strictly decreasing functions shows that we get similar results,
but this time, the sign must be flipped;
this comes from the definition of strictly decreasing,
because there we had different signs in $a < b$ and $f(a) > f(b)$.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>A strictly decreasing function can be applied on both sides when solving any inequality,
and the sign must be flipped.
</p>

</div><p>As special cases of these results, we let $a$ be any number, and we consider the functions
$f(x) = x+a$, $g(x) = x-a$, $h(x) = ax$ and $i(x) = \frac{x}{a}$:</p>

<p><ul><li>
    The functions $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing (graph is a line with slope $1$, which is positive).
    This means that they can be applied on both sides of any inequality, without flipping sign.
    Applying $f$ looks like adding $a$ on both sides, and
    applying $g$ looks like subtracting $a$ on both sides.
</li><li>
    The graph of $h$ is a line with slope $a$, and
    <ul><li>
        if $a > 0$, then $h$ is strictly increasing;
    </li><li>
        if $a < 0$, then $h$ is strictly decreasing;
    </li><li>
        if $a = 0$, then $h$ is neither strictly nor strictly decreasing.
    </li></ul>
    Applying $h$ on both sides of an inequality looks like multiplying by $a$.
</li><li>
    The function $i$ can be written as
    $$
    i(x) = \frac{1}{a} x,
    $$
    so the graph of $i$ is a line with slope $\frac{1}{a}$.
    That's positive if $a$ is positive, and negative if $a$ is negative.
    This means that $i$ is strictly increasing for positive $a$, and strictly decreasing for negative $a$.
    If $a=0$, then $i(x)$ is undefined for all $x$.

<p>Combining all this with the previous result, we get the following.</p>

<div class="box graybox"><p>When solving an inequality, we can
<ul><li>
    add or subtract a number on both sides without flipping sign,
</li><li>
    multiply or divide by a positive number on both sides without flipping sign, and
</li><li>
    multiply or divide by a negative number on both sides and flip the sign.
