<h1 id="math-derivations">Math Derivations<a class="headerlink" href="#math-derivations" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h1><p>This site contains derivations of math results that are commonly used in high school math.
</p>

<h2 id="goals-and-non-goals">Goals and non-goals<a class="headerlink" href="#goals-and-non-goals" title="Link to this title">¶</a></h2><p>The purpose of this site is to share nice ways to understand
why high school math works like teachers claim.
As far as I know, the only <strike>people</strike> person reading this is a student,
but some of this could be useful for teachers as well.
Most of the derivations are created by <a href="https://github.com/Akuli">me</a>,
but in most cases, I'm quite sure that I'm not the first person who finds the derivation.</p>

<p>The goal is <b>not</b> to start with a set of axioms,
and then prove everything from the axioms and only from the axioms.
Instead of axioms, I tend to use things that are intuitively clear.
For example, consider how I <a href="analytic-plane-geometry/line-eq-normal.html">derive the equation of a line</a>.
Instead of giving a long list of axioms about lines,
I write so that it convinces you if you think about what lines look like.
I also tend to prefer visual things over long calculations,
although I do the calculations and symbol manipulations when needed.
