Akuli	ignoring matrices, what operations do we use in linear algebra anyway?
Akuli	we have vector+vector and number*vector
Akuli	together with those we can do linear combinations
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	subtraction isn't really a separate operation:   v-w = v + (-1)*w
Akuli	just consists of those two
Akuli	ok?
adder	yeah likewise for division 1/x
adder	* 1/x
adder	(correct?)
Akuli	yeah, note that we never divide by vectors
Akuli	so vector/2 is (1/2)*vector
Akuli	but 2/vector is undefined and bad
adder	ok
Akuli	so it's really just vector+vector and number*vector
adder	just one sec
adder	how about dot and cross products?
Akuli	we haven't used them yet
adder	that still falls within *
Akuli	hmm, yes and no
adder	are they valid lin. alg. operations?
Akuli	i said "ignoring matrices"
Akuli	i should have said "ignoring matrices and a lot of other operations" :D
adder	ok
Akuli	but really the core of the thing is vector+vector and number*vector
Akuli	a lot can be done with just those
adder	ok
Akuli	linear independence and spans, for example
Akuli	our next concept is a subspace
adder	what is ittttttt
Akuli	a set of vectors can either be a subspace or not be a subspace
Akuli	so a subspace is a set of vectors that satisfies specific conditions
adder	is this maybe the R thing I keep seeing on #math
Akuli	there's 3 conditions: it must be non-empty, adding vectors in the set must not produce anything outside the set, and multiplying vectors of the set by any number also must produce vectors in the set
Akuli	so basically, it must be not a dumb corner case we want to ignore (non-empty)
adder	ok that sounds simple
Akuli	and when you do our two favorite operations, you don't end up outside that set, you can basically calculate with just the elements of that set without needing anything from the outside
Akuli	definition ok?
adder	the name checks out
adder	yeah
Akuli	yeah it does
Akuli	"space" in general means something where you can work in
Akuli	"subspace" is just a subset inside the set of all n-dimensional vectors
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	let's explore what sets are subspaces and what aren't
Akuli	let's start small
Akuli	is {(1,0)} a subspace?
Akuli	it's non-empty, that checks out
Akuli	let's try adding
adder	with itself?
Akuli	well, we need to pick two subspace elements to add
adder	there are no other vectors
Akuli	it should work for any two
Akuli	so we'll have to add it with itself because there's no other choice
adder	aha ok
Akuli	(1,0) + (1,0) = (2,0)
Akuli	oops
adder	then it's not because we get 2, 0
Akuli	yeah, not a subspace
Akuli	let's try to fix this problem by adding (2,0) there
Akuli	{(1,0), (2,0)}
Akuli	is this a subspace?
adder	no, (3,0) is outside the set
Akuli	yeah :D
Akuli	ok, let's say it's {(1,0), (2,0), (3,0), ...}
adder	{(0,0)} is?
Akuli	we add all positive integers
Akuli	good!
Akuli	{(0,0)} is a subspace
Akuli	it satisfies all the rules: no matter what you do you stay in that set :)
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	so let's try to get our {(1,0)} set thing to work
Akuli	we have to add at least all vectors like (positive_integer, 0)
Akuli	just because of +
Akuli	ok?
adder	yeah
Akuli	so let's say it's {(1,0), (2,0), (3,0), ...}
Akuli	then it satisfies the + rule, and also is non-empty
adder	as long as it has the null vector it's a subspace
adder	(I think)
Akuli	let's talk about that then
adder	because (3,0) * (0,0) = (0,0)
Akuli	we don't have vector*vector, only vector*number
Akuli	but let's try {(3,0), (0,0)}
Akuli	it's not actually a subspace
Akuli	(3,0) + (3,0) = (6,0)
Akuli	goes outside it again
Akuli	ok?
adder	but why are you not adding it up with (0,0)? why (3,0)?
Akuli	ah, the definition was a bit unclear
Akuli	you should be able to freely combine any vectors within the subspace
Akuli	whatever vectors you pick, it has to stay in the subspace for it to be a subspace
adder	aha so it must stand for any pair of vectors within the set
Akuli	right
Akuli	and similarly in multiplication, it must work with any vector and any number
adder	but where do we get a number? it's a set of vectors
Akuli	a set of vectors is a subspace if ... and (any vector from the set)*(any number) is in the set
adder	ahaa
adder	ok
Akuli	so for example, our {(1,0), (2,0), ...} thing is definitely not a subspace
Akuli	multiply by -1 and it goes boom
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	so let's try {(any integer, 0)}
adder	I'm starting to think a subspace doesn't exist :D
Akuli	multiply by 1/2 and we go outside it again
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	so let's try (any number whatsoever, 0)
Akuli	let's try adding
Akuli	(x, 0) + (y, 0) = (x+y, 0) = (some number, 0)
Akuli	seems to check out
Akuli	how about multiplying?  x*(y, 0) = (xy, 0) = (some number, 0)
Akuli	we found a subspace! :D
adder	wait wait wait
adder	why are you saying 'any number' when we were working with vectors?
Akuli	(good thing you keep interrupting me, it's been a while since i taught math)
Akuli	our subspace candidate is now an infinite set of all vectors of the form (x,0) where x is any number whatsoever
Akuli	so for every number there's a corresponding vector in our subspace candidate set
adder	aaaaaaaah that's a vector
adder	sorry
Akuli	and now it does satisfy the properties
adder	so wait, how does our first subspace look? name one
Akuli	our subspace is basically the x axis
Akuli	"a vector is in this set" just comes down to "second component of the vector is zero" which means "the vector is on the x axis"
Akuli	and if you add/scale vectors on the x axis, surely you stay on the x axis
Akuli	so the x axis is a subspace
adder	ok
Akuli	do you notice what we did?
adder	anything different for y axis?
Akuli	no
Akuli	that would also be a subspace
Akuli	hm
Akuli	so if we take a vector (1,0) and want to make a subspace containing it, we need the whole x axis
adder	yeah
Akuli	at no point did we add anything unnecessary, and eventually x axis was it
adder	ok
Akuli	let's try with two vectors
Akuli	say (1,0) and (0,1)
Akuli	and let's see what do we need to put into our subspace to make one that contains both of them
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	we need number*(1,0) and number*(0,1)
Akuli	this is probably a quicker way to get started than adding
Akuli	adding worked but we got confused by thinking it's some kind of integers thing, after all we needed to ditch that and take all numbers anwyay
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	so it has to contain the whole x axis and the whole y axis
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	this is only from number*vector rule, non-emptiness is clearly fine
Akuli	we still need vector1+vector2 rule
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
adder	(1,1) is outside axes
Akuli	yeah
Akuli	but we actually do need it
Akuli	(1,1) = (1,0) + (0,1) = subspacevector + subspacevector
Akuli	so (1,1) has to go into our subspace too
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	how about say (-7, 35.2)?
Akuli	can we make that by adding x axis and y axis vectors, i.e. do we need it in the subspace?
adder	I don't think so
Akuli	look at this :D
Akuli	(-7, 0)  = x axis vector
Akuli	(0, 35.2) = y axis vector
Akuli	adding together:
Akuli	(-7, 35.2) = subspace vector
Akuli	so we DO need to include that in our subspace
Akuli	ok?
adder	I'm a bit confused, is this still the same subspace 23:24:12 my time
adder	subspace from
Akuli	ok, let's backtrack a bit
adder	the one with (1,0) and (0,1)?
Akuli	our goal was to make the smallest possible subspace containing (1,0) and (0,1), see what do we really need to put in a subspace other than those
Akuli	we found out that we need at least the whole x axis and the whole y axis
adder	yeah
Akuli	(because you can multiply (1,0) and (0,1) by a number)
Akuli	we found out that we also need at least (1,1)  (because you can add (1,0) from x axis and (0,1) from y axis)
Akuli	i'm saying that you might as well add (-7,0) from x axis and (0,35.2) from y axis
adder	is the answer: a plane
Akuli	yeah :)
Akuli	it's the entire xy plane, i.e. the set of all 2D vectors
Akuli	once we do that, it is obviously a subspace
Akuli	non-empty and obviously contains everytihgn you can get by adding/multiplying its vectors

<p><pre style="white-space: break-spaces">
adder	this looks a lot like spans?
Akuli	yes!!!
Akuli	we just computed span((1,0),(0,1))
adder	:DD
Akuli	in fact: span(vectors) = smallest subspace containing all vectors
adder	I'll brb
Akuli	ok :)
Akuli	send a message (or ping me) when back
adder	ping Akuli 
Akuli	pong
Akuli	so we tried to make the smallest possible subspace containing some vectors and ended up with span(vectors)
Akuli	let's try to figure out if/why this works in general
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	so we have two sets
Akuli	span(vectors) and smallest_subspace_containing(vectors)
Akuli	the obvious part is:   span(vectors).issubset(smallest_subspace_containing(vectors))
Akuli	meaning that every vector in the span is also in the subspace
Akuli	this is because of how you can + and * within a subspace and that's all that spans do
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	.issubset() isn't quite same as == though
Akuli	what if the smallest subspace containing those vectors isn't just the span but also contains something else?
Akuli	then they would be different sets but .issubset() would be happy
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	we still have to rule out that possibility, but then we're done
Akuli	so taking a step back, we're trying to compare the span to some subspace
Akuli	maybe it would help to figure out if the span even is a subspace
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	that would actually help a lot
Akuli	every subspace has to contain the span
Akuli	and if the span is a subspace, there can't be any smaller subspaces (because they would contain the span)
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	so if we can see somehow that the span is a subspace, it's automatically the smallest subspace containing those vectors
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	so let's see if span(vectors) is a subspace :)
Akuli	is it non-empty?
adder	yes?
Akuli	yes :D
Akuli	now for some more interesting parts
Akuli	does span_element+span_element stay within the span?
Akuli	let's try
Akuli	let's say we have 3 vectors we're making the span of:  span(u,v,w)
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	then all span elements look like au+bv+cw
Akuli	let's take two of those and add them together
Akuli	a1 u + b1 v + c1 w + a2 u + b2 v + c2 w
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	= (a1+a2)u + (b1+b2)v = (c1+c2)w
Akuli	= (some number)u + (some number)v + (some number)w
Akuli	= span element
adder	so #2 good
Akuli	yeah
Akuli	lets do #3
Akuli	x*(span element) = x*(au+bv+cw)
Akuli	= (xa)u + (xb)v + (xc)w
Akuli	= span element
Akuli	ok?
adder	I don't follow the last =
Akuli	yeah ok
Akuli	= (xa)u + (xb)v + (xc)w    (previous step)
Akuli	= (some number)u + (some number)v + (some number)w
Akuli	= span element
adder	ah
adder	o
adder	ok
Akuli	so #3 good :)
adder	so #3 good too
Akuli	so actually, "the smallest subspace containing these vectors" amounts to "the span of these vectors"
Akuli	at least with finitely many vectors
adder	ok :D cool
adder	now, does this help us in computing? 
Akuli	hm, not in any obvious way
Akuli	we have mostly introduced a new name and an alternative definition for an existing thing
Akuli	whether or not that turns out useful is to be seen later
Akuli	ok?
adder	yeah ok some terminology can't hurt

Akuli	there's one more corner case i want to cover
Akuli	the smallest subspace containing specific vectors is a span
Akuli	but is any subspace in fact just a span of something?
Akuli	could there be some subspace that isn't the span of anything?
Akuli	let's tackle that next
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	the subspace could be {(0,0)} first of all
Akuli	but we can just take span((0,0)) or something to correspond with it then
Akuli	kind of a dumb case but that seems to work
Akuli	and in general, if something isn't working you will often find out with some simple example, so this check is a good idea anyway :)
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	so let's say the subspace is something else than {(0,0)}, our goal is to see if it is span(something)
Akuli	it must contain at least one nonzero vector
Akuli	(otherwise it would be the {(0,0)} subspace as that's the only subspace containing only one vector)
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	so some nonzero vector n is in the subspace
Akuli	then number*n is in the subspace
Akuli	that's just span(n)
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	so if that's the whole subspace we're done, it turned out to be a span
Akuli	but there could be more to the subspace than that
Akuli	let's say there's a subspace vector s that wasn't captured by span(n)
Akuli	so, subspace = {multiples of n, multiples of s, ...}
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	it has to contain everything in span(n, s) then
Akuli	(because + and * stay within the subspace)
Akuli	and now if the subspace is span(n, s) we're done
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	the subspace could still contain something more, say v
Akuli	then it must contain span(n, s, v)
Akuli	if that's the whole subspace we're done
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	you get the idea
Akuli	if it turns out our span thing didn't "fill" the entire subspace, we just update it and try again
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	so the only corner case where this doesn't work would be a subspace where we add more and more things to our span, and never reach the whole subspace
Akuli	ok?
adder	ok
Akuli	but here's the thing
Akuli	at every step the vectors we're spanning are linearly independent!
Akuli	we're never adding anything redundant to the span, that would be dependent vectors
adder	right ok
Akuli	every vector we add grew the span
Akuli	and we have an upper bound for the number of independent vectors!
Akuli	if these are n dimensional vectors, we won't go beyond span(v1,v2,...,vn)
adder	right
Akuli	so eventually we reach the entire subspace
Akuli	and that's why "a subspace" really means "a span of some vectors"
adder	:)
Akuli	if you say "a subspace" you just don't care what those vectors are
Akuli	i was going to define "a subspace" this way but "a span of vectors we don't know ???" just seems weird and arbitrary
adder	ok
Akuli	i think that's it for today :)
adder	:D
adder	thanks, feels good to be learning math again
Akuli	this was fun :D
adder	I'll be back tomorrow
